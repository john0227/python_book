== Chapter 4 - Conditional Statements

Conditional, also known as branching statements, can be used to allow your program make decisions based on certain conditions...but what does this mean? Let's look at an example.

Let's look at the decisions you might make during your typical day.

[%header, cols="<.^50%,<.^50%"]
|====
^| *Condition* ^| *Action*
| If you are hungry | Then you eat food
| If you are thirsty | Then you drink water
| If you have homework | Then you finish your homework
| If you are bored | Then you play games
| If you are tired | Then you go to sleep
|====

As shown above, based on some conditions, the actions you may take are different. However, what if you are bored _and_ have homework? What will you do? To account for such situations, you need to establish a more concrete set of conditions. As such, it is essential to come up with appropriate conditions and the actions that follow.

=== _if_ Statements

An _if_ statement in Python has the following structure:

.*Structure of an `if` Statement*
[source,python]
----
1    if <condition>:
2        <action>
----

The part indicated by `<condition>` must be a boolean value, variable holding a boolean value, or an expression that evaluates to a boolean value, and the part marked as `<action>` can be anything, ranging from variable assignments to writing `print()` statements. `<action>` is executed if and only if `<condition>` evaluates to the boolean value `True`. For example:

.*Boolean Expression*
[source,python]
----
1    x = 5
2    y = 10
3
4    if x > y:  # False
5        print('x is greater than y')
6    if x < y:  # True
7        print('x is less than y')
----

.*Output*
----
x is less than y
----

Let's take a look at the example line by line.

* At lines 1-2, the interpreter creates two variables, `x` and `y`.
* At line 4, the interpreter evaluates the expression inside the _if_ statement, and we can see that `x > y` evaluates to `False`.
* Since the condition evaluates to `False`, the interpreter *does not* read line 5 and *skips* to line 6. For any _if_ statement, if the condition evaluates to `False`, the interpreter will skip the _if_ block and go straight to the next section.
* At line 6, the condition evaluates to `True`. Therefore, the interpreter will enter the block and read line 7, thus printing `x is less than y` on the CLI.

Hence, only line 7 is executed.

Also, a crucial part to note is that codes you write for the `<action>` section must be one indent rightward compared to the `<condition>` statement. For example:

.*Indentation Example 1*
[source,python]
----
1    if is_hungry:
2        print('Get up')
3        print('Go to kitchen')
4        print('Cook food')
5        print('Eat food')
----

In the above example, lines 2-5 would be executed if the variable `is_hungry` is holding the boolean value `True`. It is different, however, to the next example.

.*Indentation Example 2*
[source,python]
----
1    if is_hungry:
2        print('Get up')
3        print('Go to kitchen')
4        print('Cook food')
5    print('Eat food')
----

In this example, lines 2-4 would be executed if `is_hungry` is `True`. However, line 5 would be executed regardless of the boolean value that is stored in `is_hungry`.

If `is_hungry` is `False`:

Eat food

----
1    x = 5
2    if x % 2 == 0:
3        print('x is even')
4    if x % 2 != 0:
5        print('x is odd')
----

.*#Answer#*
----
x is odd
----

2    if name == 'Steve' or name == 'John':
3        print('Hi', name)
4    if name.startswith('J'):
5        print('Your name starts with a J')
----

.*#Answer#*
----

Your name starts with a J

=== _else_ and _elif_ Statements

_else_ and _elif_ (short for _else if_) statements are used when we want to designate an _action_ for the program to take when the condition for _if_ statement is not taken. Hence, they are also referred to as _alternative executions_.

.*Alternative Branches Structure*
[source,python]
----
if <cond1>:
    <action1>
elif <cond2>:
    <action2>
else:
    <action3>
----

`<action1>` (_if_ block) is executed if and only if: ::
`<cond1>` evaluates to `True`

`<action2>` (_elif_ block) is executed if and only if: ::
`<cond1>` evaluates to `False`, *and* `<cond2>` evaluates to `True`

`<action3>` (_else_ block) is executed if and only if: ::
`<cond1>` and `<cond2>` both evaluate to `False`

====
This means that the above is equivalent to writing:

[source,python]
----
if <cond1>:
    <action1>
if <not cond1 and cond2>:
    <action2>
if <not cond1 and not cond2>:
    <action3>
----

This may seem trivial at first, but it is crucial that you understand this concept well to correctly utilize _if_ statements in larger programs.
====

So suppose that `<cond1>` evaluates to `True`:

* The interpreter moves to line 1 and sees that condition is `True`. So it moves to line 2 and executes `<action1>`.
* Since the _if_ block was entered, the interpreter skips the corresponding `elif` and `else` blocks. Hence, none of `<action2>` or `<action3>` is executed.

Likewise, in the chain of conditional statements, if the interpreter enters one block, it will skip all the subsequent blocks. This is an example of _short-circuiting_ and will be covered <<short-circuit,below>>.

.*Chained Conditionals Example*
[source,python]
----
Evaluate the output of the following program:

 1    x, y = 5, 10
 2    if x < y:
 3        print('This is the if block')
 4        print('x < y')
 5    elif x <= y:
 6        print('This is the elif block')
 7        print('x <= y')
 8    else:
 9        print('This is the else block')
10        print('x >= y')
----

.*Output*
----
This is the if block
x < y
----

Even though both `x < y` (line 2) and `x \<= y` (line 4) are true, since the interpreter enters the _if_ block first, the _elif_ block is skipped and thus, not executed.

====
[[short-circuit]]
*Short-Circuiting*

Short-circuiting is the act of terminating an operation or a check prematurely for optimization purposes. Remember that in a chain of _if-elif-else_ statements, if one block is entered, Python will _prematurely terminate_ the condition checks of the rest of the _if_ statements and skip over to the next section.

Let's look at the following example:

.*short_circuit.py*
[source,python]
----
1    x, y = 5, 10
2
3    if x < y:  # True
4        print('if-block is entered')
5    elif what_is_this:  # not checked
6        print('This condition is not checked')
----

.*Output*
----
if-block is entered
----

Even though we do not have a variable named `what_is_this`, the Python interpreter does not raise an exception when we execute the program. This blatantly shows that since the condition in the _if_ statement on line 3 was `True`, the interpreter executed the action in line 4 and skipped over the rest of the chain. Although you should not do something like this in your program, this example effectively shows what _short-circuiting_ is doing.

.#*Exercise 4.3: Write an if statement*#
----
Get a user input for an integer number. If the number is divisible by 3, print the quotient, and if it is not, print the resulting remainder when the number is divided by 3.
----

.*#Answer#*
[source,python]
----
1    num = int(input('Please enter an integer number: '))
2    if num % 3 == 0:
3        print(num // 3)
4    else:
5        print(num % 3)
----

.#*Exercise 4.4: Write an if statement*#
----
Get user input of two strings. Print the first string if the first string is a substring of the second string. If it is not, print the second string. A string is a substring of another if it is contained inside the other string. For example, 'cat' is a substring of 'catnip', and 'dog' is a substring of 'hotdog'
----

.#*Answer*#
[source,python]
----
1    str1, str2 = input(), input()
2    if str1 in str2:
3        print(str1)
4    else:
5        print(str2)
----

.#*Exercise 4.5: Write an if statement*#
----
Get a user input of a number between 0 and 100 (inclusive). This number represents a student's score. Print the letter grade that corresponds to the number value in the following scale:

   * A (90 <= grade <= 100)
   * B (80 <= grade < 90)
   * C (70 <= grade < 80)
   * D (60 <= grade < 70)
   * F ( 0 <= grade < 60)

Assume user input is always correct.
----

.*#Answer#*
[source,python]
----
 1    grade = int(input("Enter student's score (0-100): "))
 2    if grade <= 100 and grade >= 90:
 3        print('A')
 4    elif grade >= 80:
 5        print('B')
 6    elif grade >= 70:
 7        print('C')
 8    elif grade >= 60:
 9        print('D')
10    else:
11       print('F')
----

=== Nested If Statements

It is possible to use _if_ statements inside an _if_ statement, which is called a _nested if_ statement.

.*Nested _if_ Statement*
[source,python]
----
if <cond>:
    <action1>
else:
    if <inner_cond>:
        <action2>
    else:
        <action3>
----

The two inner _if-else_ blocks will be reached if and only if `<cond>` evaluates to `False`.

This would be the same as writing:

.*Chained _if_ Statement*
[source,python]
----
if <cond>:
    <action1>
elif <inner_cond>:
    <action2>
else:
    # Or elif <not cond and not inner_cond>:
    <action4>
----

As you can see, the second example has only one level of indentation, while the first had two levels. Whenever appropriate, the second method is preferred. However, in some cases, the first example may be more readable and useful to group certain conditions together. For example, look at the following case:

[%noheader,grid="none",frame="none",cols="^.^65%,<.^35%"]
|====
a|
image::ch3_nested_if1.png[]
a|
[source,python]
----
if has_hw:
    if is_urgent:
        do_hw()
    else:
        relax()
else:
    if likes_outdoors:
        play_sports()
    else:
        play_vgames()
----

a|
image::ch3_nested_if2.png[]
a|
[source,python]
----
if has_hw and is_urgent:
    do_hw()
elif has_hw and not is_urgent:
    relax()
elif not has_hw and likes_outdoors:
    play_sports()
else:
    play_vgames()
----
|====

The first image is a depiction of a nested _if_ statement, while the second image is a depiction of a chained _if_ statement. In this case, the first image is much more readable and easy to understand than the second. If we were to write a chained _if_ statement, we would have to check the condition `has_hw` twice (first in line 1 and second in line 3). As such, you should avoid nested __if__s when possible but use them when appropriate.

4        if i % 4 == 0:
5            print('First print statement')
6        else:
7            print('Second print statement')
8    else:
9        print('Third print statement')
----

[[if-data-types]]
=== *Challenge:* _if_ and Different Data Types

In Python, all values of every data type correspond to a boolean value.

[%header,cols="^.^50%,^.^50%"]
|====
| Value | Corresponding Boolean Value
| `None` .8+| `False`
| `0` (`int`)
| `0.0` (`float`)
| `''` (`str`)
| `False` (`bool`)
| `[]` (`list`)
| `()` (`tuple`)
| `{}` (`dict`)
| The rest | `True`
|====

[NOTE]
[small]#The keyword `None` represents a null value (different to `0`, `0.0`, `''`, etc). Any variable with a `None` value is essentially empty and void.#

Such values evaluate to their corresponding boolean value when used with the keywords `if`, `elif`, `else`, and `not`, and the Python function `bool()`. You can memorize this by remembering that all the "_empty_" values of each data type corresponds to `False`, and the rest is `True`.

.*Examples*
[source,python]
----
 1    empty_int, empty_float, empty_str = 0, 0.0, ''
 2    empty_list, empty_tup, empty_dict = [], (), {}
 3
 4    print(bool(empty_int))
 5    print(not empty_float)
 6    if not empty_str:
 7        print('str is empty!')
 8    if not empty_list:
 9        print('list is empty!')
10    if not empty_tup:
11        print('tuple is empty!')
12    if not empty_dict:
13        print('dictionary is empty!')
----

.*Output*
----
False
True
str is empty!
list is empty!
tuple is empty!
dictionary is empty!
----

As such, this property can be used to check if an _iterable_ is empty (i.e. does not contain any elements/characters), just like the example did with the if-statements.

=== *Challenge:* Short-Circuiting of Logical Expressions

[NOTE]
Short-circuiting was explained briefly before in <<short-circuit, this section>>.

Remember logical expressions? They are expressions with logical operators, which, in Python, are `and`, `or`, and `not`.

To briefly recap, `and` and `or` are binary operators, which means they operate on two operands, and `not` is a unary operator, which means it has one operand. The `and` operator evaluates to `True` if both operands are `True`, and on the contrary, the `or` operator evaluates to `False` if both operands are `False`.

In other words, if _any one_ of the operands of the `and` operator is `False`, the expression will evaluate to `False`. Likewise, if _any one_ of the operands of the `or` operator is `True`, the expression will evaluate to `True`. How can we use this information to optimize the speed of the `and` and `or` operations?

Let's look at the following example:

.*Short-Circuiting of Logical Expressions*
[source,python]
----
1    # 1 / 0 -> division by zero should cause Python to raise an exception
2    print(False and 1 / 0)
3    print(True or 1 / 0)
----

.*Output*
----
False
True
----

First of all, for any logical operators, the operands must be of a boolean type (which `1 / 0` is not), and second of all, `1 / 0` is dividing by zero, which should cause Python to raise the `ZeroDivisionError` (Try it out yourself on Python shell!). So judging by these facts, Python should have raised an exception when we tried to execute the previous program, but why were `False` and `True` printed without any problem?

This is because Python exhibits a behavior called short-circuiting when performing logical operations, which means the interpreter _prematurely terminates_ the evaluation of logical expressions on certain occasions.

[%noheader,frame="none",grid="none",cols="<.^60%,<.^40%"]

2+h| [Big]#Short-circuiting for `and` Expressions#
a|
image::ch3_shortcircuit_and.jpg[]
a|
For an `and` expression (like line 2),

* *If* the first operand evaluates to `False`
* *Then* no matter what the boolean value of the second operand is, the expression will evaluate to `False`

Therefore, Python skips the evaluation of the second operand all together.

2+h| [Big]#Short-circuiting for `or` Expressions#
a|
image::ch3_shortcircuit_or.jpg[]
a|
For an `or` expression (like line 3),

* *If* the first operand evaluates to `True`
* *Then* no matter what the boolean value of the second operand is, the expression will evaluate to `True`

Therefore, Python skips the evaluation of the second operand all together.
|====

[big]#*Use Cases*#

*Example 1*

Let's say at CSM Amusement Park, a ticket is discounted by 15% for people with ages under 7 or over 60. As the IT manager, you implement the following piece of code:

[source,python]
----
1    age = int(input('What is your age? '))
2    if age < 7 or age > 60:
3        # Discount ticket price
----

If the user inputs `6` as their age, at line 2, Python will evaluate `age < 7` and see that it is `True`. Since the user already qualifies to get a discount, there is no reason for Python to check if the user's age is over 60 (`age > 60`) once more.

*Example 2*

In order to graduate from CSM University, you need to have taken at least 120 credits of courses and have written a thesis paper. The program that checks if a student is eligible to graduate has the following piece of code:

[source,python]
----
1    std_id = # get student ID
2    if course_crd(std_id) >= 120 and has_written_thesis(std_id):
3        # Allow student to apply for graduation
----

[NOTE]
[small]#Suppose `course_crd(std_id)` returns the course credits of the student with corresponding `std_id`, and `has_written_thesis(std_id)` returns `True` if that student has written a thesis paper and `False` if not.#

Suppose the student applying for graduation has taken 80 credits of courses. Then, the student is already ineligible for graduation, so there is no need for Python to check once more whether the student has written a thesis paper or not.

Q1. Ask the user to input a nonnegative integer. If the input is correct, print a smiley face. If it is not, then print a sad face.

        E.g. Input: 10      Output: :)
             Input: hello   Output: :(

Q2. Ask the user to input a nonnegative floating point number. If the input is correct, print a smiley face. If it is not, then print a sad face.

        E.g. Input: 1.0     Output: :)
             Input: 1       Output: :(
             Input: 0.1     Output: :)
             Input: .1      Output: :(

 5    else:
 6        print(':(')

 8    # Q2
 9    num2 = input('Input a positive floating point number: ')
10    nums = num2.split('.')
11    if len(nums) == 2 and nums[0].isnumeric() and nums[1].isnumeric():
12        print(':)')
13    else:
14        print(':(')

#*Additional Remarks*#

In order for the input to be a valid floating point number, the string must consist of all numbers except one decimal point. To check that, we can split the string by the decimal point and see if the first and second element of the list are numbers.

len(nums) == 2 at line 11 is an example of utilizing short-circuiting. After the string is split by its decimal point, if the length is not 2, it means the user input is not a valid floating point number. Then there is no reason to check if nums[0] and nums[1] are numeric and can move onto the else block without evaluating the rest.

Suppose you built a program that performs different functions depending on the user commands. Take user input of two integers and a command word. How you take in the input is up to you. The following are the command words and the function your program will perform:

    Command | Function
    --------|------------------------------------------------------------
      Add   | Print the sum of the two numbers
      Sub   | Print the difference of the two numbers (in order of input)
      Mult  | Print the product of the two numbers
      Div   | Print the quotient of the two numbers (in order of input)

Your program should be case-insensitive. In other words, AdD, add, aDD should all trigger the Add command. Suppose for Div, the second number will never be zero. If the command is invalid or the first two inputs are not integers, print an error message.

    Ex1)  Input: 0, 1, Add
           Output: 1
    Ex2)  Input: 3
                  2
                  div
           Output: 1
