== Chapter 2 - Manipulating Variables

=== Variable

Variables are a very important and powerful tool that programmers use to store and manage data. The definition of variable is *something that can change or take different values*. For example, let's say an experiment was done on a group of teenagers of age 15. The names of each test subject will be different, so each subject's *_name_* can be treated as a variable. On the other hand, every subject's age are the same (15), therefore, *_age_* cannot be treated as a variable, but rather, a _constant_.

In programing, a variable is like a box that can store different values, such as numbers and words, inside.

Suppose there is a number 15. It can refer to anything, like someone's age or someone's quiz score. To clarify what the value means, the box, or the variable, is given a name. In the example above, the variable is named _age_ to signify that 15 refers to someone's age.

image::ch2_variable_ex2.jpg[]

Today, there exists tons of different data, which would be very hard to distinguish and organize without meaningful specifiers. Therefore, we store them inside variables with relevant names.

==== Basic Data Types in Python

It was mentioned that we can store different types of data in variables. But what are the different data types that exist in Python? The three basic types are numbers, strings, and boolean values.

*1. Number*

Numbers are a familiar concept of data to all of us. We use it daily, whether it is to pay for an item at a supermarket or to do our math homework. In Python, numbers are split into two parts: integers and floating point numbers.

*Integers*, or _int_ for short, are numbers that do not have decimal points.

.*Examples of integers*
* `1`
* `10`
* `253`
* `2,147,483,648`

*Floating point numbers*, or _float_ for short, are numbers with decimal points.

.*Examples of floats*
* `1.0`
* `3.14159`
* `171.3`
* `1713e-1`
* `1.713E2`

[NOTE]
====
[small]#`e` or `E` means power of 10. `1713e-1` means `1713 * 10^-1^` and `1.713E2` means `1.713 * 10^2^`. We can see that both evaluates to `171.3`.#
====

We can use the built-in `type(x)` function to check the data type of `x`. Try the following examples on Python shell and check the output.

.*`type()` Example*
----
>>> type(1)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(2_147_483_648)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(1.0)
<class 'float'>
>>> type(1713e-1)
<class 'float'>
----

[NOTE]
[small]#Line 3 says `2_147_483_648` instead of `2,147,483,648`. This is because commas have a special role in Python. We use underscores (`_`) in Python to increase readability of numbers instead of commas.#

*2. String*

Strings refers to any sequence of characters - a 'string' of characters. To express something as text, we would use strings to do that. In Python, in order to specify that something is a string, we surround the sequence of characters in single quotation marks.

.*Examples of strings in Python*
* `'strings'`
* `'Hello World'`
* `'I am 15 years old'`
* `'15'`

Like the last example, if numbers are surrounded by single quotation marks, Python will treat them as words, or strings, instead of a number.

Let's use the `type(x)` function again to check the data type of `x`.

.*`type()` Example*
----
>>> type('Hello World')
<class 'str'>
>>> type('I am 15 years old')
<class 'str'>
>>> type('15')
<class 'str'>
----

*3. Boolean*

Boolean values traditionally take two values only, 0 and 1. In computer programming, Booleans are used to express two values, _True_ and _False_.

.*Two Boolean values*
* `False` (`0`)
* `True` (`1`)

In certain cases, Python will treat `True`/`False` as `1`/`0` and vice versa.

Let's use the `type(x)` function again to check the data type of `x`.

.*`type()` Example*
----
>>> type(True)
<class 'bool'>
>>> type(False)
<class 'bool'>
----

As of now, it may not be clear how to use this data type. Later, we will use this data type to evaluate conditional expressions (e.g. if-else statements).

==== Variable Assignments

To effectively use variables, we must _assign_ values to them. In this _assignment_ step, we create a new variable with an appropriate name and give them a value.

.*assignment_ex.py*
[source,python]
----
1    age = 15
2    pi = 3.14159
3    name = 'John Doe'
4    is_same = True
5    print(age, pi, name, is_same)
----

.*Output*
----
15 3.14159 John Doe True
----

The above example showcases the variable assignments of different data types. Line 1 assigns the integer value `15` to the variable named `age`. Line 2 assigns the floating point number approximate of Ï€ to the variable `pi`. Line 3 assigns the string value `'John Doe'` to the variable `name`. Line 4 assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `is_name`. As this example shows, with meaningful variable names, others can see what the values are referring to.

The `print()` statement in line 5 is used to display the values of each variable on the computer screen for us to see. The Output section shows how each data type looks like when printed. As shown, if the values/variables are listed by commas, they are separated by one whitespace and printed. The `print()` statement will be covered in more depth under <<Printing>>.

.#*Exercise 2.1: Variable Assignment*#
[source,python]
----
Evaluate the output of the following Python program.

1    num_int = 123
2    print('Data type of', num_int, 'is:', type(num_int))
3
4    num_float = 1618e-3
5    print('Data type of', num_float, 'is:', type(num_float))
6
7    str1 = 'Python is Fun'
8    print('The variable str1 is storing the following value:', str1)
----

#*Answer*#

.*Output*
----
Data type of 123 is: <class 'int'>
Data type of 1.618 is: <class 'float'>
The variable str1 is storing the following value: Python is Fun
----

===== A. Multiple Assignment

We have showed that we can use 4 lines to create 4 variables, but can we do it in less? The answer is yes.

.*Examples of multiple assignment*
[source,python]
----
1    a, b = 1, 2
2    age, pi, name = 15, 3.14159, 'John Doe'
----

Line 1 assigns the integer value `1` to the variable `a` and the integer value `2` to the variable `b`. The number of variables and values to assign must be equal, unless there is only one variable. But as line 2 shows, the types of values to assign may be different.

.*Example of multiple assignment with one variable*
[source,python]
1    a = 1, 2, 3

If multiple values are assigned to one variable, that variable will be interpreted as a _tuple_ by Python. A tuple is another data type supported by Python, not covered currently.

.*Examples of invalid multiple assignments*
[source,python]
----
1    a, b = 1, 2, 3
2    a, b, c = 1, 2
----

Running the above lines of codes will cause Python to throw an error.

.#*Exercise 2.2: Multiple Assignment*#
----
Write a Python program to assign the values 'John Doe', 175, 68, True to the variables name, height, weight, has_siblings in one line. Check your work using the print() statement.

Values: 'John Doe', 175, 68, True
Variables: name, height, weight, has_siblings
----

#*Answer*#

.*ex2_2.py*
[source,python]
----
1    name, height, weight, has_siblings = 'John Doe', 175, 68, True
2    print(name, height, weight, has_siblings)
----

===== B. Equal Sign

Another point to note is that the equal sign (=) has a different meaning in programming than in mathematics.

In mathematics, equal sign signifies that the values on both sides are equal. `x = y` means that the value of variable `x` is the same as the value of variable `y`.

On the other hand, in computer programming, equal sign signifies that we are storing the value on the right side of the `=` sign to the variable written on the left side of the `=` sign. Therefore, `x = y` in Python means that the value of `y` is stored in variable `x`.

[source,python]
----
1    y = 10
2    x = y
----

In the above snippet of code, since the value of `y` is 10, line 2 is storing the integer value 10 to the variable `x`.

===== C. Naming Conventions of Variables

// tag::naming-convention-a[]
`Capitalized`, `PascalCase`, `camelCase` are all valid variable names. However, to standardize variable names, Python has a set of rules when naming variables.

*1. Not allowed*

... Cannot contain any characters other than alphabets, numbers, and underscores
... Cannot start with a number
... Cannot be a word reserved by Python (called a keyword)

Below shows all 35 keywords reserved by Python:

=== Operators and Expressions

==== Expressions

An *expression* is a line of code that consists of values, variables, and/or operators. An operator is used to manipulate the values of the operands. In the expression `a + b`, `+` is the operator and `a` and `b` are the operands.

.*Examples of an expression*
[source,python]
----
1    3
2    x
3    x + 3
----

==== Operators

===== A. Arithmetic Operators

[cols="^.^15%,^.^20%,<.^65%", options="header"]
|====
| Operator | Example | Description
| `+` (Unary) | `+x` | Signifies that the value/variable that follows `+` is a positive number
| `+` (Binary) | `x + y` | Adds the two operands together
| `+` (Strings) | `str1 + str2` +
`'Hello' + 'World'` => `'HelloWorld'` | Concatenates the second string to then end of the first string
| `-` (Unary) | `-x` | Signifies that the value/variable that follows `-` is a negative number
| `-` (Binary) | `x - y` | Subtracts the right hand operand from the left hand operand
| `*` | `x * y` | Multiplies the two operands
| `*` (Strings) | `str * n` +
`'a' * 4` => `aaaa` | Repeats the string operand by the number of times specified by the right hand operand
| `/` | `x / y` +
`3 / 2` => `1.5`| Divides the left hand operand by the right hand operand
| `**` | `x ** y` | Raises the left hand operand to the power of the right hand operand
| `%` | `x % y` +
`4 % 2` => `0` +
`5 % 3` => `2` | Evaluates the remainder when left hand operand is divided by the right hand operand
| `//` | `x // y` +
`3 // 2` => `1` | Performs a floor division, which means the portion after the decimal point of the quotient  is discarded. 3 divided by 2 is 1.5, so `3 // 2` discards `.5` and returns `1`.

|====
| _Additional Explanation_
| Most of the examples are self-explanatory. However, lines 24-26 seem pretty confusing. How can we add a boolean value to an integer value? Remember that Python can interpret boolean values as either `False`/`True` or `0`/`1`. If an operator is used on a numerical operand and a boolean operand, Python will convert the boolean value to its corresponding numerical value.
|`x` is `10` and `bool` is `True`. Since line 25 is adding a boolean value to a numerical value, Python converts `bool` to `1`. As a result, `11` is stored in `c`.

===== B. Relational Operators

These operators are used to compare the two operands and return their relationship. In programming, such relationship will always be a boolean value: `True` or `False`.

[cols="^.^15%,^.^20%,<.^65%", options="header"]
|====
| Operator | Example | Description
| `==` | `x == y` | If the two operands are equal in value, then the expression evaluates to True.
| `!=` | `x != y` | If the two operands are not equal in value, then the expression evaluates to True.
| `>` | `x > y` | If the left hand operand is greater than the right hand operand, then the expression evaluates to True.
| `<` | `x < y` | If the left hand operand is less than the right hand operand, then the expression evaluates to True.
| `>=` | `x >= y` | If the left hand operand is greater than or equal to the right hand operand, then the expression evaluates to True.
| `\<=` | `x \<= y` | If the left hand operand is less than or equal to the right hand operand, then the expression evaluates to True.

| *_Additional Explanation_*
| Lines 13 and 17 checks if `str1` is either greater or less, respectively, than `str2`. The relevant magnitude of two strings are compared lexicographically (using ASCII values).
| Unlike the equality operators, if we try to use the comparison operators to compare the relationship between a number and a string, Python will throw an error. For example, `10 > 'hello'` or `True \<= 'world'` will cause the Python interpreter to throw an error.

| As explained before, numerical values can be compared to boolean values. Python will convert the boolean value to its corresponding numerical value.

===== C. Logical Operators

Whereas *Relational Operators* compared the _values_ of the two operands, *Logical Operators* are mainly used to manipulate two boolean values. The resulting value will always be a boolean value. In Python, there are 3 logical operators, which are `and`, `or`, and `not`.

Let's think of the `and` and `or` operators as  function that takes in two inputs, the two operands as inputs to the function, and the result as the output. The `and` operator outputs `True` if and only if the two inputs are `True`. The `or` operator outputs `True` if and only if at least one of the two inputs is `True`.

Unlike the two operators above, the `not` operator is unary, meaning it takes only one operand. The `not` operator negates the boolean value. So if the input is `True`, the output will be `False`, and vice versa.

===== D. Bitwise Operators

Bit operators are ones that operator on _binary numbers_. ACS Theory Lesson 6 will help in understanding this section.

*Basic Explanation of Binary Numbers*

It is convenient for us to count in base 10 because we have 10 fingers. However, computers do not have fingers to count with. Instead, they can 'count' in base 2 using electricity.

Suppose there is a little light bulb inside computers that lights up if there is electricity and turns off if there is no electricity. If the light bulb lights up, the computer interprets it as a `1`, and if the light bulb is off, the computer interprets it as a `0`.

image::ch2_binary_ex1.jpg[]

The above picture is a rough demonstration of how numerical data is represented inside computers. Each `0`/`1` is called a *bit*, similar to how each number in decimal is called _digits_. Let's compare binary (base 2) numbers to decimal (base 10) numbers.

====
*If 10110 is a decimal:*

10110~10~ = 1 * 10^4^ + 0 * 10^3^ + 1 * 10^2^ + 1 * 10^1^ + 0 * 10^0^

*If 10110 is a binary number:*

10110~2~ = 1 * 2^4^ + 0 * 2^3^ + 1 * 2^2^ + 1 * 2^1^ + 0 * 2^0^ = 22~10~

[small]#*_Additional Example_* +
 +
Likewise, if 10110 is in base _n_: +
 +
10110~_n_~ = 1 * _n_^4^ + 0 * _n_^3^ + 1 * _n_^2^ + 1 * _n_^1^ + 0 * _n_^0^#
====

[NOTE]
====
[small]#In Python, we can represent binary numbers by preceding the binary number with `0b`. +
 +
For example, if there is a line that says `a = 0b10110`, the value `22~10~` is stored in the variable `a`. +
 +
In addition, in computer science, numbers in base 8 and 16 are also often used. They are called _octal_ and _hexadecimal_ numbers, respectively. +
 +
In Python, we can represent octal numbers by preceding the octal number with `0o` and hexadecimal numbers by preceding the hexadecimal number with `0x`.#
====

*Bitwise Operators*

For bitwise operators, the two operands must be integer (or boolean) values. The three bitwise operators are `&` (`and`), `|` (`or`), `^` (`xor`), and `~` (`not`).

====
[small]#`xor` is another logical operator (not in Python) that evaluates to `True` if the two boolean operands have different values.#

| [small]#`True`# | [small]#`False`# | [small]#`True`#
| [small]#`True`# | [small]#`True`# | [small]#`False`#
|====

====

If a base-10 integer is converted to a binary number, it will contain only ``0``s and ``1``s. Then, bitwise operators interpret each `0`/`1` bit as `False`/`True` and performs operations shown under <<C. Logical Operators, Section C. Logical Operators>>. The resulting boolean value is converted back to `0`/`1`.

| Operator | Example | Description
| & | `x & y` | Performs bitwise AND on `x` and `y`.
| \| | `x \| y` | Performs bitwise OR on `x` and `y`.
| ^ | `x ^ y` | Performs bitwise XOR on `x` and `y`.
| ~ | `~x` | Performs bitwise NOT on `x`.

| _Additional Explanation_
| The `\#` symbol in Line 1 is called a _comment_. Everything that follows `#` is ignored by the Python interpreter. We will go more in depth under <<Comments>>.
| The `bin(x)` statement in lines 4, 7, 10, and 13 is a built-in statement in Python that outputs a string form of `x` (decimal value) in binary. For example, `bin(22)` will return `0b10110`. +
[small]#Similarly, `oct()` and `hex()` can be used for octal and hexadecimal numbers, respectively#

a| Let's analyze how `5 & 6` works. First, `5` is converted to `101~2~` and `6` is converted to `110~2~`.

image::ch2_bitwise_ex1.jpg[width="35%",align="center"]

Remember that Python treats `1` as `True` and `0` as `False`. Therefore, `1 & 1` (same as `True and True`) evaluates to `True` and `0 & 1` evaluates to `False`. Then, `True`/`False` is converted back to `1`/`0`, hence, the result. Since `100~2~` is `4~10~`, `5 & 6` evaluates to `4`.

|====

[TIP]
[small]#If you need to check whether a number `x` is even or not, check the following condition `x & 1 == 0`. This is slightly faster than using the arithmetic modulus operator `x % 2 == 0`. This works because a binary number is even if the last bit is `0` and odd if the last bit is `1`.#

===== E. Bitwise Shift Operators

Bitwise shift operators also operate on binary numbers. More precisely, the left hand operand is converted to a binary number and the right hand operand is left as a decimal number. Bitwise shift operators shift the left hand operand (represented in binary) either to the left or right by the number of bits specified by the right hand operand.

[%header, stripes=none, grid=none]
|====
| _Example_
| *Shift 5~10~ to the left by 3 bits* +
5~10~ in binary is 101~2~. Then, we move 101~2~ to the left by 3 bits and fill the empty bits with 0. Therefore, the result is 101000~2~, or 40~10~.

Do you see a relationship between the two numbers? 40 is 8 (= 2^3^) times 5. Do you think this is a coincidence? No, it's not.

In decimal, if we shift a number `x` to the left by `n` digits, we are multiplying `x` by `10^n^`. For example, 5 shifted 3 times to the left is 5000 (= `5 * 10^3^`).

Likewise, in binary, if we shift a number `x` to the left by `n` bits, we are multiplying `x` by `2^n^`. Therefore, when we shifted 5 to the left by 3 bits, we got 40 (= `5 * 2^3^`).
| *Shift 10~10~ to the right by 1 bit* +
10~10~ in binary is 1010~2~. We move 1010~2~ to the right by 1 bit and discard the shifted bit. Since the last '0' bit is shifted, it is discarded. Therefore, we get 101~2~. If we shifted 10 to the right by 2 bits, we would have gotten 10~2~.

Similar to left shift, if we shift a number `x` to the right by `n` bits, we are performing a floor division by `2^n^`. Therefore, when we shifted 10 to the right by 2 bits, we got 2 (= `10 // 2^2^`)

==== Type Conversion

In Section 1.1, we took a look at some of the basic data types in Python. If we add two integers together, the resulting value will be an integer type. If we add two strings together, the resulting value will be a string type.

However, if we look at the division example shown in <<A. Arithmetic Operators, Section A. Arithmetic Operators>>, `3 / 2` resulted in `1.5`. At first glance, this does not seem important at all. But if we look closely, we can see that an operation with two _integer_ operands resulted in a _floating point number_. This change of data type is called a *type conversion*.

Also, in the same section, we saw that if we add two string values, the second value is concatenated to the first value. What if we want to concatenate a number to a string? For example, if I want to say `I am 12 years old`, will `'I am ' + 12 + ' years old'` work? Let's find out in the following sections.

===== A. Implicit Type Conversion

What does the word 'implicit' mean?

[horizontal]
Implicit::
. implied though not plainly expressed
. capable of being understood from something else though unexpressed

In other words, if something is expressed _implicitly_, others will be able to assume the meaning without a straightforward explanation. As such, implicit type conversion is one that Python assumes and automatically does for us.

`3 / 2` -> `1.5` is an example of implicit type conversion in Python. In some other languages, like Java or C/C++, `3 / 2` will yield `1`. Because it is an operation involving two integer values, the resulting value is also an integer value. But Python will automatically convert, or implicitly convert, integer into a _float_ data type.

Another example of an implicit type conversion in Python is operations involving booleans and numbers. We have seen that if boolean values are used in arithmetic operations, Python will treat them as either `0` (if `False`) or `1` (if `True`). Python is implicitly converting boolean values to integers (or floats).

In Python, the data types have a rank. Some of them are shown below.

[.text-center]
boolean < integer < float

We can see that boolean is of lower rank than numbers, and integer is of lower rank than floating point numbers. When Python implicitly converts data types, it will always convert from lower to higher rank, in order to *_avoid data loss_*.

If you attempted Exercise 2.12, you have seen that Q6. `'100 + 1 is ' + 101` did not work. This means that concatenating a number to a string by using the plus (`+`) operator does not work. Then what should we do in these kinds of situations?

We can use the built-in `str()`, `int()`, and `float()` functions.

`str(x)`::
`str(x)` function will convert `x` into its corresponding string value.
+
[source,python]
----
1    str(10)                           # yields '10'
2    type(str(10))                     # yields '<class 'str'>'
3    str(3.14)                         # yields '3.14'
4    str(1 + 2 + 3)                    # yields '6'
5    'I am ' + str(15) + ' years old'  # yields 'I am 15 years old'
----

`int(x)`::
`int(x)` will convert `x` into its corresponding integer value.
+
[source,python]
----
1    int('13')        # yields 13
2    type(int('13'))  # yields '<class 'int'>'
3    int('  14  ')    # yields 14
4    int(3.14)        # yields 3
5    10 + int('15')   # yields 25
----

`int(x, b)`::
`int(x, b)` will interpret the string value `x` as a number in base `b` and yield the corresponding integer value (in base 10).
+
[source,python]
----
1    int('10', 2)    # yields 2
2    int('1011', 2)  # yields 11
3    int('13', 8)    # yields 11
4    int('b', 16)    # yields 11
----

`float(x)`::
`float(x)` will convert `x` into its corresponding float value.
+
[source,python]
----
1    float(10)           # yields 10.0
2    type(float(10))     # yields '<class 'float'>'
3    float('3.14')       # yields 3.14
4    float(' 1  ')       # yields 1.0
5    1.0 + float('2.0')  # yields 3.0
----

Explicit type conversion can also be called type casting because we are _casting_, or forcefully imposing, another data type to the values.

.#*Exercise 2.13: Explicit Type Conversion*#
----
What are the results of the following expressions?
Also check the data type of the result using type() statement if applicable (read Section 1.1 if you forgot what type() statement is).

Q1. int('13' + '14')
Q2. int('13' + ' 14')
Q3. int(13 + '14')
Q4. str(123) + '456'
Q5. 123 + int('456')
Q6. str(int('1010', 2))
Q7. 4 / 2 == float(2)

2+<.^| *Q6.* '10', <class 'str'>
h| Explanation
| [small]#`'1010'` is interpreted as a binary number, which is `10` in decimal. So `str(int('1010', 2))` evaluates to `str(10)`, which yields `'10'`.#

2+<.^| *Q7.* True, <class 'bool'>
h| Explanation
| [small]#The left hand side of the equation evaluates to `2.0`, and the right hand side also evaluates to `2.0`. So the equation is `True`.#

==== Order of Operations

Now that we have looked at seven types of operators, if you saw the following statement, how would you solve it?

=== Printing

When we are programming, we may want to display information on screen, whether it is to check the output or debug. Since computers cannot talk, displaying information on screen is sometimes a convenient way to communicate with the computer while coding.

To achieve this, we can use the built-in `print()` function. We have seen this function a few times in previous examples and exercises. Now, let's take a deeper look at this function.

==== print(_x_)

`print(x)` will first convert `x` into its corresponding string value. If `x` is an expression, the expression will be evaluated first, then converted to a string value. Then, the string value will be printed on screen, and the cursor moves to the next line.

.*print_ex.py*
[source,python]
----
1    print('Hello World')
2    print(1 + 2 + 3)
3    print('I have ' + str(3) + ' cats')
----

.*Output*
----
Hello World
6
I have 3 cats
----

[width="100%", stripes=none, grid=none]
|====
| _Additional Explanation_
| `print('Hello World')` displays `Hello World` on screen, then the cursor is moved to the next line. The second statement, `print(1 + 2 +3)` prints `6` from where the cursor is placed, which is the line after `Hello World`. That is why the output is separated by lines.

a| If the `print()` statement did not move the cursor to the next line, the output will look like:

----
Hello World6I have 3 cats

===== Escape Characters

What if we want to print single quotations with the `print()` statement? Can we write the following?

 print('I said, 'Hello'')

To achieve this task, we can use a special character, called backslash (`\`). Below lists some of the most commonly used escape characters (characters used with a backslash). If you want to learn more, Google is your best friend.

[%header, cols="^.^20%,^.^30%,<.^50%", stripes=none]
|====
| Escape Character | Name ^.^| Description
| `\n` | newline | Moves the cursor to the next line
| `\t` | tab | Prints the ASCII Horizontal Tab (TAB)
| `\'` | Single quote | Prints a single quote
| `\"` | Double quote | Prints a double quote
|====

.*escape_characters_ex.py*
[source,python]
----
1    print('Hello World\n')
2    print('\ta')
3    print('I said, \'Hello\'')
4    print('I said, \"Hello\"')
----

.*Output*
----
Hello World

        a
I said, 'Hello'
I said, "Hello"
----

[width="100%", stripes=none, grid=none]
|====
| _Additional Explanation_
| The output from Line 1 results in a blank line. Why is this so? If we include the escape character `'\n'`, the escape character will move the cursor to the next line once. Then, the `print()` statement will move the cursor to the next line once more time, causing a blank line.
|====

[NOTE]
[small]#Since we use single quotes to represent strings, using double quotes without the backslash character is also fine. For example, `print('I said, "Hello"')` will also print `I said, "Hello"`. +
 +
The reason why there is a `\"` is because, in Python, we can represent strings with double quotes as well (although this is discouraged). If we used double quotation marks, then we would have to write `print("I said, \"Hello\"")`, in order to print `I said, "Hello"`. +
 +
Similarly, we can use single quotes without the backslash character if we represent strings with double quotation marks. For example, `print("I said, 'Hello'")` will print `I said, 'Hello'`.#

==== print(_x1_, _x2_, ...)

This is the statement that was used often in previous exercises. The values to be printed are separated by commas. Then Python will print all of the values separated by a single whitespace.

----

[width="100%", stripes=none, grid=none]
|====
| _Additional Explanation_
| Line 1 is trying to print three integer values. `1`, `2`, and `3` are converted into strings and printed, separated by a single whitespace. It is equivalent to saying `print(str(1) + " " + str(2) + " " + str(3))`.
| Line 2 shows that you can print strings together with numbers by listing them with commas. This is a clearer and more concise alternative to writing `print('I have ' + str(3) + ' cats')`.

==== print(_x_, end=_s_)

`print(x, end=s)` will concatenate `s` to the end of `x` and print the resulting value without moving the cursor to the next line.

It was mentioned before that the `print()` statement automatically moves the cursor to the next line. This was a very simplified way of explaining the `print()` statement. In reality, when we use the `print()` statement, `s` is set to `'\n'` by default. Therefore, `print(x)` is equivalent to `print(x, end='\n')`. In any case where the value for `end` is not specified, it is set to `'\n'` by default.

.*end_print_ex.py*
[source,python]
----
1    print('Hello World', end='\n')

[width="100%", stripes=none, grid=none]
|====
| _Additional Explanation_
| Line 1 is equivalent to saying `print('Hello World')`.
| Line 2 concatenates two newline characters to the end of `'1 2 3'`, so a blank line is created.
| Line 3 concatenates `'World '` to the end of `'Hello'` (which results in `'HelloWorld '`) and is printed without moving the cursor to the next line. Therefore, the `print()` statement in Line 4 starts from the end of `'HelloWorld '`.

----
|====

==== print(_x_..., sep=_s_)

`print(x\..., sep=s)` will separate the given values `x\...` by the given string `s`. For example, if we say `print(x1, x2, x3, sep=s)`, it equivalent to saying `print(x1 + s + x2 + s + x3)`, assuming `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are all string values.

Remember that if we list multiple values with commas, the values are printed separated by a single whitespace. This is because `sep` value is set to `' '` by default.

.*sep_print_ex.py*

| Line 1 is equivalent to saying `print('Hello', 'World')`.
| Line 2 is equivalent to saying `print(str(1) + '+' + str(2) + '+' + str(3))`.
| Nothing happens in Line 4 because there is only one value. This `print()` statement joins multiple values together separated by the `sep` value. If there is only one value, there is nothing to join together.

=== Input

So far, to store a value inside a variable, we specified it directly in the program. For example, if we wanted to store the value `10` in the variable `a`, we would have to write a line in our program as such: `a = 10`. However, say we have a program to store personal data. We would have hundreds or thousands of users using our program. To store each user's information, such as their name, age, and gender, we cannot be updating our program directly each time. We need the users to input their own information and a way for our program to interpret and store the users' inputted information.

To do this, we use the built-in `input()` function.

==== input(_prompt_)

To see what `input(prompt)` function does, let's take a look at an example.

.*input_ex1.py*
[source,python]
----
1    name = input('What is your name: ')
2    print('User\'s name is ' + name)
----

.*CLI*
----
What is your name: John Doe
User's name is John Doe
----

[NOTE]
[small]#CLI (command line interface) is a platform where you can interact with your program.#

[width="100%", stripes=none, grid=none]
|====
| _Explanation_
| `input('What is your name: ')` in Line 1 prints the prompt message `'What is your name: '` on screen (without a newline character).
| The user types his/her input on the CLI. In this example, the user typed `John Doe` as the input and pressed kbd:[enter] (which is recognized as a newline character).
| When Python sees the newline character, Python takes all the characters from after the prompt message and before (and not including) the newline character and stores it in the variable `name` as a string type. Therefore, after the user presses kbd:[enter], `'John Doe'` is stored in the variable `name`.
| Line 2 prints the user's name along with some explanatory text.
|====

`input()` treats all user inputs as a string. In order to treat them as other data types, such as integers or floats, we have to type cast them (covered under <<B. Explicit Type Conversion>>).

.*input_ex2.py*
[source,python]
----
 1    # Input section
 2    name = input('Write your name: ')
 3    age = int(input('Write your age: '))
 4    letter = input('Write a letter: ')
 5    pi_approx = float(input('Write the pi approximate: '))
 6
 7    # Output section
 8    print('Your name is', name)
 9    print('You are', age, 'years old')
10    print('Your letter is', letter)
11    print('Pi is approximately', pi_approx)
----

.*CLI*
----
Write your name: John Doe
Write your age: 24
Write a letter: A
Write the pi approximate: 3.14159
Your name is John Doe
You are 24 years old
Your letter is A
Pi is approximately 3.14159

This section covers some tips on how you can become a better programmer.

==== Coding Style

Just like how spoken languages have grammar, programming languages have syntax. And no matter how your code is written, as long as it correctly follows the syntax, the Python interpreter will be able to understand it. However, it might not be the case for humans. If you start working, you will not be the only one looking at your code. Others would have to take a look and make corrections or give feedback on your work. Suppose you saw the following block of code:

[source,python]
----
 1    A= 3
 2    B=5
 3
 4    a= int(input())
 5    b =  int(input() )
 6
 7    c =  a+b
 8    d= a  *A  + b*B
 9
10    print(c , d)
----

Can you tell what this snippet of code is trying to achieve? It can be an example showcasing the use of different arithmetic operators, or it can be a program to calculate something more meaningful, like ticket prices. Also, the code does not look clean overall. The following snippet of code would be more appreciated by your peers or coworkers:

[source,python]
----
 1    # Calculate and display the total number of visitors coming to this zoo
 2    # and the total ticket price.
 3
 4    CHILD_TICKET_PRICE = 3  # in dollars
 5    ADULT_TICKET_PRICE = 5  # in dollars
 6
 7    num_child = int(input('Number of children: '))
 8    num_adult = int(input('Number of adults: '))
 9
10    total_visitor = num_child + num_adult
11    total_price = num_child * CHILD_TICKET_PRICE + num_adult * ADULT_TICKET_PRICE
12
13    print('Total number of visitors:', total_visitor)
14    print('Total ticket price:', total_price)
----

How well a code can be understood by other people is called _readability_, and Python has a set of styling guidelines to make your code more _readable_ to others. Let's take a look at some of them.

===== A. Variable Naming Conventions

[small]#*pass:q[* Included from]* *<<C. Naming Conventions of Variables>>*#

'''

include::python_book.adoc[tag=naming-convention-a]
include::python_book.adoc[tag=naming-convention-b]

'''

Also, there is a difference when naming constants and variables. As covered before, constants are values that do not change, like pi and speed of light, and variables are values that can change. As shown above, variable names should be in lowercase.

Constants should follow the same rules as other variables, but they should all be capitalized.

[source,python]
----
4    CHILD_TICKET_PRICE = 3  # in dollars
5    ADULT_TICKET_PRICE = 5  # in dollars
----

We know that ticket prices for children and adults will not change, so we set them as constants when we write our code. When we do so, we capitalize their names to let others know that the corresponding variable is storing a constant value.

===== B. Spacing

Remember the first code example? It looked like the following:

[source,python]
----
 1    A = 3
 2    B = 5
 3
 4    a = int(input())
 5    b =  int(input() )
 6
 7    c = a+b
 8    d = a  *A  + b*B
 9
10    print(c , d)
----

See lines 5, 7, 8, and 10? What do they all have in common? They have spacing issues.

Generally, for expressions, we separate operands and operators (except for unary operators) with one whitespace.

----
# Binary operators
operand_a operator operand_b

# Ternary operators
operand_a operator operand_b operator operand_c
----

Below are some examples.

[source,python]
----
# Unary operators (no space)
+x
-x
~x

# Binary operators
# Bad
x+y
x- y
x  *  y
a=6

# Good
x + y
x - y
x * y
a = 6

# Ternary operator
# Bad
x  if boolean_condition  else  y

# Good
x if boolean_condition else y
----

When we are listing things with a comma, we place the comma right after the previous element with no space and separate the next element with one space.

----
A, B, C, D, ...
----

Below are some examples.

[source,python]
----
# Bad
print(x,y,z)
print(x , y , z)

# Good
print(x, y, z)
----

===== C. Comments

It was briefly mentioned before that whatever comes after `#` is called a _comment_. A comment is not recognized by the Python interpreter and will have no effect whatsoever on your code.

Then why should we write comments? After finishing a long piece of code, if you leave it and come back a few months later, chances are, you will not be able to understand what you wrote. To help you and others understand what your code is talking about, it is necessary to write meaningful comments.

The two types of comments that we are going to cover are _block comments_ and _inline comments_.

[discrete]
====== Block Comments

What is a block? Let's look at the previous example again and find out.

[source,python]
----
 1    # Calculate and display the total number of visitors coming to this zoo
 2    # and the total ticket price.
 3
 4    CHILD_TICKET_PRICE = 3  # in dollars
 5    ADULT_TICKET_PRICE = 5  # in dollars
 6
 7    num_child = int(input('Number of children: '))
 8    num_adult = int(input('Number of adults: '))
 9
10    total_visitor = num_child + num_adult
11    total_price = num_child * CHILD_TICKET_PRICE + num_adult * ADULT_TICKET_PRICE
12
13    print('Total number of visitors:', total_visitor)
14    print('Total ticket price:', total_price)
----

You can see that all the code in Lines 1-14 are performing one task: to calculate the total number of visitors and ticket price. Likewise, a _block_ in Python can be loosely defined as a set of code that serves the same purpose or task.

Another way to think of a _block_ is to check if a chunk of code has the same indentation. Later, you will learn _if-statements_ and _while-loops_ that will have different indentations. Those would also be containing distinct _blocks_ of code.

Then what is a _block comment_? It is a comment explaining what the subsequent _code block_ is trying to do.

[source,python]
----
1    # Calculate and display the total number of visitors coming to this zoo
2    # and the total ticket price.
----

This block comment explains what Lines 4-14 are trying to achieve. As such, meaningful block comments can help others understand what your program is doing without dissecting each line of code.

Block comments should be placed in the same indentation level as the following block. Also, each block comment should generally start with a `#` followed by a single whitespace. For example:

[source,python]
----
# Bad
#   Calculate and display the total number of visitors coming to this zoo
#   and the total ticket price.

    # Calculate and display the total number of visitors coming to this zoo
    # and the total ticket price.

# Good
# Calculate and display the total number of visitors coming to this zoo
# and the total ticket price.
----

[discrete]
====== Inline Comment

Like the name suggests, an _inline comment_ is one that is written in the same line as the statement you are trying to explain.

[source,python]
----
4    CHILD_TICKET_PRICE = 3  # in dollars
5    ADULT_TICKET_PRICE = 5  # in dollars
----

This is an example of inline comments. `# in dollars` explains that the written price is measured in dollars.

As shown in the example, inline comments should be written at least two spaces from the statement you are trying to explain. Also, like block comments, they should start with a `#` followed by a single whitespace.

However, try to avoid overusing inline comments, especially if the line of code is very obvious.

[source,python]
----
# Bad
x = x + 1  # increment x by 1
name = input()  # Get user's name
print(name)  # print the user's name
----

== Chapter 3 - Lists, Strings, and More

[[lists]]
=== Lists

==== What is a List?

Suppose there is a school with a class size of 26 students. As a member of the IT department, it is your responsibility to organize and manage student data. So if you want to store all the students' names of each class, how would you do it? Should you make 26 `name` variables and store each student's name, like the following?

image::ch4_list_ex1.jpg[]

The answer is we can use a _list_. A list is a collection, or a sequence, of elements. For the above example, instead of creating 26 separate variables for each student, we can create one _list_ object that can hold 26 different values, whether it be names, ages, or genders.

image::ch4_list_ex2.jpg[]

==== Initialization

A list is a data type supported by Python, like numbers, strings, and booleans. To create lists in Python, we use square brackets (`[]`).

.*List Examples*
[source,python]
----
1    [1, 2, 3, 4]  # list of 4 integers
2    ['Alice', 'Bill', 'Charlie', 'Zoe']  # list of 4 strings
3    [1, 'Alice', 2, 'Bill']  # a list can contain values/variables of different types
----

All three lines are examples of a list in Python. As it shows, each element is separated with a comma (`,`), and the elements of a list can be of different types. We can also assign a list to a variable.

.*List Assignment*
[source,python]
----
1    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
2    names = ['Alice', 'Bill', 'Charlie', 'Zoe']
3    empty_list = []
----

Assigning is the same as you would do for other data types, such as numbers, strings, and booleans. If you look carefully at the variable names, you can see that they are plural (except for line 3). Generally, for names of list variables, you should use the plural form of the kind of data you are storing in that list.

.*List Naming Convention*
[source,python]
----
1    # only storing one 'name'
2    name = 'Alice'
3    # storing multiple 'names'
4    names = ['Alice', 'Bill', 'Charlie', 'Zoe']
----

Python also allows you to print lists using the `print()` statement.

.*Printing Lists*
[source,python]
----
1    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
2    names = ['Alice', 'Bill', 'Charlie', 'Zoe']
3    print(numbers)
4    print(names)
----

.*Output*
----
[1, 2, 3, 4]
['Alice', 'Bill', 'Charlie', 'Zoe']
----

.#*Exercise 3.1: Create your own list*#
----
Q1. Create an empty list.
Q2. Create a list with only even numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
Q3. Create a list with 5 arbitrary string values.
Q4. Create a list with 5 random values (of any variable types).
----

.#*Answer*#
[source,python]
----
1    # Q1
2    empty_list = []
3    # Q2
4    even_nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
5    # Q3
6    lst_strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']  # any strings
7    # Q4
8    rand_lst = [1, 'abc', True, [2, 3], 10]  # any values
----

[discrete]
===== Nested Lists

Since a list can contain elements of any type, can a list contain a list? The answer is yes, and we call those _nested lists_.

.*Nested List Example*
[source,python]
----
1    nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
----

The important thing to note is that `nested_list` is a list with 3 elements (not 9), where each element is another list containing 3 elements.

image::ch4_nested_list_ex1.jpg[width="70%",align="center"]

We also call lists with similar structures as `nested_list` _2D lists_ because they can be used to describe a 2 dimensional board. For example, we can use a 2D list to describe a tic-tac-toe board.

[cols=2,stripes="none",grid="none",border="none"]
|====
a|
.*2D List Example*
[source,python]
----
1    board = [['O', 'X', 'O'],
2             ['O', 'X', 'X'],
3             ['X', 'O', 'O']]
----
.^a|
image::ch4_nested_list_ex2.jpg[width="60%",align="center"]
|====

Similarly, we can have 3D, 4D, and other higher dimensional lists, but as of now, you only need to know 1D and 2D lists.

==== Accessing List Elements

Now we know how to create lists, but how do we access the information inside the list? Just like how we created the list, we can use the square bracket operator (`[]`) to access the list elements. We also call this the _index operator_. But first, we have to become comfortable with how list _indices_ work in Python (and other languages as well).

Let's look at the example list we covered before:

image::ch4_list_ex2.jpg[]

In the non-programming world, if we were to give indices to the elements in `name_list`, we would do it as follows:

image::ch4_list_index_ex1.jpg[]

`'Alice'` would be at index `1`, `'Bill'` would be at index `2`, and so on.

However, Python (and most other languages) uses a zero-based indexing system, which means the start index is 0, like the following:

image::ch4_list_index_ex2.jpg[]

Notice that for 26 elements, the index starts from `0` and ends at `25`. As such, for any list with `n` elements, the index will go from `0` to `n - 1`.

[NOTE]
[small]#`n` is the _length_ of the list#

So if we want to access the elements in `name_list`, we can do the following:

[source,python]
----
# Suppose name_list is already initialized and filled with values
name_list[0]   # -> 'Alice'
name_list[1]   # -> 'Bill'
name_list[25]  # -> 'Zoe'
----

===== Out of Range Indices

Now we know that the index system of a list with `n` elements will go from `0` to `n - 1`. What would happen if we tried to access an index that is less than `0` or greater than `n - 1`? Let's try it out in Python shell.

.*Out of Range Index (Python Shell)*
----
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # index: 0 ~ 4
>>> numbers[-1]
5
>>> numbers[-5]
1
>>> numbers[-6]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
>>> numbers[5]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
----

The description and name of the exception do not matter, but the results seem strange, doesn't it? Why do some negative numbers work while others cause errors? If negative numbers work, why don't numbers greater than `4` work?

Python is unique in that it allows some range of negative index numbers to allow accessing of elements in reverse order. In fact, for a list with `n` elements, the index does not start from `0`, but from `-n` to `n - 1`. Therefore, the list `numbers` has the following indexing system:

image::ch4_list_index_ex3.jpg[]

You can also think of negative indices as the following:

[source,python]
----
1    # a has 5 elements
2    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
3    n = 5  # length of a
4
5    # Negative index can be offset by the list's length
6    a[-5]  # equivalent to a[-5 + n] = a[0]
7    a[-1]  # equivalent to a[-1 + n] = a[4]
----

Now, try comparing this figure with the shell output above. The reason why `numbers[-6]` and `numbers[5]` caused errors is because they were out of the valid index range (`-5` to `4`). For any list with `n` elements, if you try to access an index that is out of range (from `-n` to `n - 1`), Python will raise an exception.

==== List Operations, Functions, and Methods

To use lists more effectively, we need to know the different operators, functions, and methods we can use with lists.

===== A. List Operators

[%header,cols="^.^10%,^.^20%,^.^20%,50%",stripes=none]
|====
| Operator | Name | Example | Description
| `[]` | Index Operator | `lst[x]` | Accesses element at specified index.
| `+` | `+` Operator | `lst_a + lst_b` | Concatenates the second list to the end of the first list.

In line 7, `d` (= `['a', 'b', 'c']`) is concatenated to the end of `a` (= `[1, 2, 3]`), so the list `[1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']` is assigned to the variable `e`.

Like in line 3, "lst = [0] * 10" is the Python "equivalent" to Java's "int[] lst = new int[10]". In Python, the * operator can be used to intialize a list (of immutable data types, like int, float, string, and boolean) of a fixed length.

    [0] * 10     <==> int[] lst = new int[10]
    [0.0] * 10   <==> double[] lst = new double[10]

For any expression in the form `a == b`, where `a` and `b` are lists, it will evaluate to `True` if for all index `i`, `a[i] == b[i]` is `True`. In other words, the elements of `a` and `b` must be equal and in the same order.

In line 5, we check if the contents of `a` (= `[1, 2, 3]`) and `b` (= `[1, 2, 3]`) are equal and in the same order. Since they are, `True` is printed.

In line 6, we check if the contents of `a` (= `[1, 2, 3]`) and `c` (= `[1, 2, 3, 4]`) are equal and in the same order. Since they are not, `False` is printed (`a[3]` is invalid while `c[3]` is `4`, so `a[i] == c[i]` is `False` when `i` is `3`).

Similarly, we can use `!=` to check if the two lists are _not equal_.

In line 7, it shows that we can use the `not` operator with `in` to check if the element is not present in the list. Since `d` (= `'d'`) is not present in `c` (= `['a', 'b', 'c']`), the boolean value `True` is assigned to the variable `f`.

For any expression in the form `a[x:y]`, where `a` is a list and `x`, `y` are integers, it will return a list containing elements of `a` from index `x` (inclusive) to index `y` (exclusive). This means element at index `y` will not be included.

In line 2, the list `a` (= `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`) is sliced from index `2` to index `5`. Element at index `2` is `3`, and element at index `5` is `6`. So the resulting sliced list is `[3, 4, 5]`, excluding `6`.

In line 3, the list `a` is sliced from index `0` to index `6`. If you recall, when accessing elements, the valid index range for a list with `6` elements is `-6` to `5`. However, since the element at second index is excluded when slicing, we can use the index `6` to include the last element of the list `a`. Therefore, for any list, say `lst`, with `n` elements, `lst[0:n]` is equal to `lst` (i.e. `lst[0:n] == lst` evaluates to `True`).

In line 4, no indices are specified. If the first index is not specified, it is defaulted to `0`, and if the second index is not specified, it is defaulted to `n` (length of list). In the case of line 4, since both indices are not specified, `a[:]` is defaulted to `a[0:6]`, thus printing the whole list. Similarly, `a[:4]` would be equivalent to `a[0:4]`, and `a[4:]` would be equivalent to `a[4:6]`.

Lines 7 and 8 show that we can use negative indices when slicing. Line 7 is equivalent to writing `print(a[5:1])`. Since the start index is greater than the end index, it returns an empty list (`[]`). Line 8 is equivalent to writing `print(a[0:6])`, which is the same as line 3.

Line 11 shows that we can use any integer when slicing. The indices do not have to be in the valid range. Suppose a list has a length of `n`. If the number provided is greater than `n`, it will default to `n`. If the number provided is less than `-n`, it will default to `-n` (or `0`). Therefore, line 11 is equivalent to writing `print(a[4:6])`.

a| `len(a)`, where `a` is a list, will return the length of `a` (i.e. the number of elements in `a`). Since both `a` and `b` have 6 elements, lines 4 and 5 print `6`.

The following was not covered yet, but to check if a given list, `a`, is empty, you can write:
[source,python]
if len(a) == 0:
    ...

However, in Python, writing the following is more accepted:
[source,python]
if not a:
    ...

a| `max(a)`, where `a` is a list, will return the maximum element of `a`. The formal definition of a maximum element `M` is as follows:
====
for all index `i` of list `a`, if `M >= a[i]` is `True`, then `M` is the maximum element of `a`
====
Basically, the maximum element will always be greater than or equal to (`>=`) all the other elements of the list. This may seem obvious for numbers, but it can be helpful when thinking of strings or other objects in the future. In line 8, since the ASCII value for lowercase letters is greater than that of uppercase letters, `'c'` is the maximum element of list `b`.

a| `min(a)`, where `a` is a list, will return the minimum element of `a`. Similarly, the formal definition of a minimum element `m` is as follows:
====
for all index `i` of list `a`, if `m \<= a[i]` is `True`, then `m` is the minimum element of `a`
====
In line 11, since the ASCII value for uppercase letters is less than that of lowercase letters, `'A'` is the minimum element of list `b`.

a| `sorted(a)`, where `a` is a list, will return `a` sorted in increasing order. In other words, if index `x` is less than `y`, `a[x]` will be less than or equal to `a[y]` (i.e. `a[x] \<= a[y]` is `True`). +
In line 14, since uppercase letters have lower ASCII values than lowercase letters, `sorted(b)` is `['A', 'B', 'C', 'a', 'b', 'c']`.

| Notice that there is no example of `sum()` for list `b`. This is because `sum()` only works if the list contains only integers.

.#*Additional Remarks (Teacher's Ed.)*#
----
The boolean value True is equivalent to the integer value 1. So when min(a) is executed, both 1 and True can be thought of as the minimum element. In this case, since 1 is located before True, min(a) evaluates to 1. Likewise, for sorted(a), 1 is placed before True. If a = [True, 1, 2, 3], min(a) would evaluate to True and sorted(a) would evaluate to [True, 1, 2, 3].
So if there are multiple possible minimum (or maximum) elements, the one with the lowest index is chosen.

.#*Additional Remarks (Teacher's Ed.)*#
----
When defining max(), min(), and sorted(), it was stated that the condition M >= a[i] or m <= a[i] must be True. This means that each element of the list must be comparable to one another. In this case, the list a contains integers and strings, which cannot be compared, so using the functions max(), min(), and sorted() cause the interpreter to raise a TypeError.
----

===== C. List Methods

What is a method? A method is a function that is associated with an object. So what is the difference between a function and a method?

Suppose we have a list `lst`, a function `f()`, and a method `m()`.

To use the function `f()`, we would write `f(lst)`. The function takes `lst` as a parameter, or input. On the other hand, to use the method `m()`, we would write `lst.m()` because the method `m()` is associated with the list `lst` object. The method `m()` does not take `lst` as a parameter.

We will cover this in more depth later. For now, you can think of it as something similar to a function.

These are some of Python's built-in list methods:

[%header,cols="^.^15%,^.^25%,60%",stripes=none]
|====
| Method | Example | Description
| `append()` | `a.append(el)` | Adds the element `el` to the end of list `a`
| `extend()` | `a.extend(it)` | Extends the list `a` by adding all elements of the iterable<<iterable-def,^[1]^>> `it`
| `insert()` | `a.insert(i, el)` | Adds the element `el` at index `i` of list `a`
| `index()` | `a.index(el)` | Returns the index of element `el` if it exists +
If not, the interpreter raises a `ValueError`
| `count()` | `a.count(el)` | Returns the number of elements `el` in list `a`
| `sort()` | `a.sort()` | Sorts `a` in increasing order
| `reverse()` | `a.reverse()` | Reverses the order of elements in `a`
| `clear()` | `a.clear()` | Removes all elements of list `a`
| `remove()` | `a.remove(el)` | Removes `el` if it exists +
If not, the interpreter raises a `ValueError`
| `pop()` | `a.pop(i)` +
`a.pop()` | If index `i` is provided, removes and returns the element at index `i` +
If not, removes and returns the last element of `a`

----

At first glance, the methods `append()` and `extend()` seems identical. However, lines 6-14 show the difference between the two. `a.append(el)` treats `el` as *one* element. This is why at line 12, the list `[1, 2, 3]` is the fourth _element_ of `lst1`. `len(lst1)` would evaluate to 4 instead of 6. `extend(it)` will add each element of `it` as its own _separate_ element, which is why `len(lst2)` would evaluate to 6. If you want to add the elements of one list to the end of another, you should use the `extend()` method.

====
Since strings are also iterables, appending and extending a string will have different effects.

Suppose the two methods are executed independently of each other:

[fira-code]#a = [1, 2, 3]# +
[fira-code]#a.append('py')  # a -> [1, 2, 3, 'py']# +
[fira-code]#a.extend('py')  # a -> [1, 2, 3, 'p', 'y']#
====

After executing `a.insert(i, el)`, the element originally at index `i` would be pushed back one slot. This is why after line 3, the element `4`, which was at index `2`, is pushed back to index `3`. Since `el` is placed at index `i`, to add `el` to the front, you should write `a.insert(0, el)`, and to add `el` to the end, you should write `a.insert(len(a), el)` (which is equivalent to `a.append(el)`).

For all three methods, the return value is `None`. If you do something like `a = [1, 2, 3].append(4)`, `None` will be stored in `a` instead of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

----

From line 4, we can see that the parameter `el` to be specified in the `count()` method does not have to be present in the list. In contrast, the parameter `el` to be specified in `index()` should be present in the list. To ensure that the element is in the list, line 6 should be written as such:

[source,python]
----
if 1 in a:
    print(a.index(1))
# else:
#    print('1 not present in a')
----

Lines 7-8 introduce other parameters the `index()` method can take. The full parameters of the method is `a.index(el[, start[, end]])`. The square brackets, `[]`, signifies that the parameter(s) inside is/are optional. If all three parameters are provided, `el` is searched within the range from `start` to `end` (exclusive).

Also, since `[, end]` is nested inside the outer list, `start` (located in the outer list) takes priority over `end`. This means that if two parameters are provided for the `index()` method, it would be assigned to `el` and `start`, instead of `el` and `end` (this notation is used in official Python documentation, so it would be good to get used to it).

For example, in line 7, two parameters are provided. Therefore, the element to search is `1` and the start index is `2`. This is why `1` at index `0` is skipped. In line 8, the interpreter tries to search for `1` from index `1` to `3` of `a`, which is `[2, 3]`, because end index is excluded. Since there is no `1`, `ValueError` is raised by the interpreter.

6    a.reverse()
7    print('Then reverse a:', a)
8    b.sort(reverse=True)
9    print('Sort b in reverse:', b)
----

.*Output*
----
Sort a: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Then reverse a: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Sort b in reverse: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
----

These two methods are pretty self-explanatory, but the `sort()` method has an optional `reverse` parameter. This parameter takes in a boolean value. When passing a boolean value, you must put `reverse=` and specify the parameter name, like it was done in line 8. If it is set to `True` (like in line 8), the list would be sorted in reverse, or descending, order. Therefore, lines 7 and 9 print the same resulting list.

One question you may have now is what is the difference between the `sort()` method and the `sorted()` function? `a.sort()` sorts and changes `a` directly and returns nothing, or `None`. On the contrary, `sorted(a)` returns the _sorted list_ of `a` without changing `a`.

.*Difference between `sort()` and `sorted()`*
[source,python]
----
 1    a = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 6]
 2    print('a.sort() results')
 3    c = a.sort()
 4    print('a:', a)
 5    print('c:', c)
 6
 7    print('\nsorted(a) results')
 8    a = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 6]
 9    c = sorted(a)
10    print('a:', a)
11    print('c:', c)
----

.*Output*
----
a.sort() results
a: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
c: None

sorted(a) results
a: [4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 6]
c: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
----

You can see that for `a.sort()`, the list `a` is sorted while nothing is stored in `c`, whereas for `sorted(a)`, `a` remains unchanged while `c` holds the sorted version of `a`.

==== Editing List Elements

===== A. Updating Elements

To update list elements, we use a combination of assignment and index operators.

.*Update Example*
[source,python]
----
1    lst = [1, 2, 6, 4, 5]
2    lst[2] = 3
3    print(lst)
----

.*Output*
----
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
----

In the above example, line 2 is where the update is happening. If we look at the line closely, we can see that we are assigning the integer value `3` to the 2^nd^ index of the list `lst`. Since indexing in Python is zero-based, the third element `6` is changed to `3`.

It is also possible to use expressions as list indices.

.*Expressions as Indices*
[source,python]
----
1    i = 2
2    lst = [1, 2, 6, 4, 5]
3    lst[i] = 3
4    lst[i + 1] = 10
5    lst[1 + 3] = 1
6    print(lst)
----

.*Output*
----
[1, 2, 3, 10, 1]
----

We can also use the slice operator to update a range of elements.

.*Bulk Update Example*
[source,python]
----
 1    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 2    a[2:4] = [10, 11]
 3    print(a)
 4
 5    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 6    a[2:4] = [10, 11, 12]
 7    print(a)
 8
 9    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
10    a[2:4] = [10]
11    print(a)
----

.*Output*
----
[1, 2, 10, 11, 5, 6]
[1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 5, 6]
[1, 2, 10, 5, 6]
----

In lines 2, 6, and 10, we are updating a range of elements of list `a`, specifically from index `2` to index `4` (exclusive). In other words, we are updating `[3, 4]` of `a` (= `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`).

In line 2, we are updating `[3, 4]` with `[10, 11]`. Hence, `a` is changed from `[1, 2, *3, 4*, 5, 6]` to `[1, 2, *10, 11*, 5, 6]`.

Lines 6 and 10 show that the numbers of elements to update can be different. For example, `a[2:4]` corresponds to 2 elements, but in line 6, we are assigning a list of 3 elements. As a result, `[3, 4]` of `a` is changed to `[10, 11, 12]`, ultimately updating `a` from `[1, 2, *3, 4*, 5, 6]` to `[1, 2, *10, 11, 12*, 5, 6]`.

Similarly, in line 10, `a` is changed from `[1, 2, *3, 4*, 5, 6]` to `[1, 2, *10*, 5, 6]`.

.#*Exercise 3.13: Write your own program*#
----
Look at the before and after of each list and write a program to reflect the changes.

Name |        Before        |        After
  a  | ['a', 'x', 'c', 'd'] | ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
  b  | [2, 4, 5, 7, 8]      | [2, 4, 6, 8]
  c  | [1, 2, 3, 4]         | [1, 2, []]
----

.#*Answer*#
[source,python]
----
1    a = ['a', 'x', 'c', 'd']  # Before
2    a[1] = 'b'                # After
3
4    b = [2, 4, 5, 7, 8]  # Before
5    b[2:4] = [6]         # After
6
7    c = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # Before
8    c[2:] = [[]]      # After
9    print(a, b, c, sep='\n')
----

===== B. Deleting Elements

There are multiple ways to delete list elements. The first is to use the `del` operator.

.*`del` Operator Example*
[source,python]
----
1    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
2    del a[1]
3    print(a)
4
5    # Can also use splice operator to delete a range of elements
6    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
7    del a[2:5]
8    print(a)
----

.*Output*
----
[1, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[1, 2, 6]
----

The `del` operator is a reserved Python keyword, shown in a chart earlier in <<Chapter2.adoc#naming-conventions, Chapter 2>>. It deletes the specified element(s).

In line 2, we are telling Python to delete the element at index `1` of the list `a`. As a result, `a` is changed from `[1, *2*, 3, 4, 5, 6]` to `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

In line 7, we are telling Python to delete the elements in the range of index `2` to index `5` (exclusive). As a result, `a` is changed from `[1, 2, *3, 4, 5*, 6]` to `[1, 2, 6]`.

There are 3 additional methods we can use besides the `del` operator. The first is the `clear()` method.

.*`clear()` Example*
[source,python]
----
1    a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
2    a.clear()  # equivalent to del a[:]
3    print(a)
----

.*Output*
----
[]
----

As shown, the `clear()` method removes _all_ elements of the list. Line 2 shows that using `del a[:]` has the same effect as writing `a.clear()` since `a[:]` corresponds to the whole list. This is different from writing `del a` because this will delete the list object `a`.

.*Difference between `del a[:]` and `del a`*
----
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> del a[:]
>>> a
[]
>>> del a
>>> a
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
----

The second way is to use the `pop()` method.

.*`pop()` Example (Python Shell)*
----
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> a.pop()
4
>>> a
[1, 2, 3]
>>> a.pop(1)
2
>>> a
[1, 3]
----

`a.pop()` removes the last element of list `a` and returns it, whereas `a.pop(i)` removes the element at the `i`-th index and returns it. In this example, at the start, since `4` was the last element of `a`, `a.pop()` removed and returned `4`. Then, since the element `2` was at index `1`, `a.pop(1)` removed and returned `2`.

The last way is to use the `remove()` method.

.*`remove()` Example (Python Shell)*
----
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]
>>> a.remove(4)
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 2]
>>> a.remove(2)
>>> a
[1, 3, 2]
>>> a.remove(5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list
----

`a.remove(el)` removes the element `el` from the list `a`. Therefore, `a.remove(4)` and `a.remove(2)` each removed the elements `4` and `2`, respectively, from the list `a`. If there are duplicate elements in list, the element with the lowest index will be removed. This is why `a.remove(2)` resulted in `[1, 3, 2]`, instead of `[1, 2, 3]`. However, if the element `el` is not in the list, the interpreter raises a `ValueError` as shown in the last line. Hence, it is a safe practice to check if the element is in the list before trying to remove it.

[source,python]
----
1    a = [...]  # arbitrary values
2    if el in a:
3        a.remove(a)
----

The obvious difference between `pop()` and `remove()` is that `pop()` uses index to determine the element to remove, and `remove()` uses the value of the element. The second is that `pop()` will _return_ the removed element while `remove()` will not. `remove()` does not need to return the element because the user will know which element is getting removed anyway.

.#*Exercise 3.14: Which to use?*#
----
Look at each situation and decide which of del, pop(), or reverse() is the best to use. Explain the reason for your choice.

Q1. You are making a card game program. Each player has a deck of cards (implemented as a list). When the opponent chooses an index, you have to remove that card from your deck and give it to your opponent. Which should you use?

Q2. You are creating a music player program. You want the user to be able to search for the name of a song and remove it from the current playlist. Which should you use?
    (Assume the user will always search for a song that exists in the playlist)

Q3. In a luck-based game, you have to roll a dice (suppose the number is n) and throw away first n items from your bag. Which should you use?
----

.#*Answer*#
----
Q1. Answer: pop()
    Reason: reverse() is not the best choice because the opponent chooses the index of the card. del is not optimal because you need to give the card to your opponent. Using del would delete the card altogether. Using pop() will allow you to get the removed card (as the return value).

Q2. Answer: remove()
    Reason: You do not know the index of the song, so you cannot use pop() and del.

Q3. Answer: del or pop()
    Reason: remove() is not the best choice as you are throwing the first n items (i.e. index 0 to n - 1). You do not know the value of items that are being discarded. del may be a slightly simpler solution as you can use the slice operator to delete multiple items at once. If you use pop(), you would need to use a loop.
----

==== *Challenge:* Mutability of Lists

In Python, a list is _mutable_, but what does that mean? Let's look deeper and find out what implications this has on the use of lists in Python.

===== A. What is Mutability?
// refer to https://medium.com/@meghamohan/mutable-and-immutable-side-of-python-c2145cf72747

In Python, everything is an object, which means the variables _refer_ to its values instead of directly holding it. For example, when the interpreter executes the statement `a = 5`, a space in the computer's memory is created in order to store the value `5` first. Then, the variable `a` will point to the location, or memory address, of the value `5` in the computer's memory. Each object is given a unique ID that can be checked with the built-in function `id()`. This ID can be thought of as something similar to the object's memory address.

.*`id()` Example (Python Shell)*
----
>>> a = 5
>>> b = 'Hello World'
>>> id(a)
140704463574176
>>> id(b)
2104611965104
----

The numbers may be different for you, but the point is that `id()` can be used to check the unique ID of the object a variable is pointing to.

Going back to mutability, if an object is said to be _mutable_, it means the object's value can be changed. In contrast, if an object is _immutable_, it means the object's value cannot be changed. Examples of immutable values are integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Let's look at the following example:

.*Immutability of Integers*
----
>>> a = 5
>>> b = a
>>> a, b
(5, 5)
>>> id(a), id(b)
(140704463574176, 140704463574176)
>>> id(a) == id(b)
True
>>> a = a + 1
>>> a, b
(6, 5)
>>> id(a), id(b)
(140704463574208, 140704463574176)
>>> id(a) == id(b)
False
----

Now because the value of `a` changed, you can question why and how integers are immutable. And indeed the value, or object, that `a` was referring to has changed, but the integer object `5` did not. We can see that the ID of `a` has changed, indicating that the object `a` is referring to has changed, but that the ID of `b` has not, indicating that the object `5` was not altered. The following picture may better explain what happened:

image::ch4_immutable_integers.jpg[]

As the image shows, the object `5` is never changed. Instead, a new object `6` is created, which is then referred by `a`. If integers were mutable, at step 3, instead of creating a new object `6` and having `a` point to it, `5` would be changed to the object `6`  (at the memory address `â€¦176`), pointed to by both `a` and `b`.

Since lists are mutable, how would they behave?

.*Mutability of Lists*
----
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = a
>>> a, b
([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])
>>> id(a), id(b)
(2104611963656, 2104611963656)
>>> id(a) == id(b)
True
>>> a[1] = 10
>>> a, b
([1, 10, 3], [1, 10, 3])
>>> id(a), id(b)
(2104611963656, 2104611963656)
>>> id(a) == id(b)
True
----

We can see that the ID of `a` did not change even though the content of the list `a` has, which indicates that the list object (`[1, 2, 3]`) created in the first line was changed, or _mutated_. The following picture shows what happened:

image::ch4_mutable_lists.jpg[]

Since lists are mutable, the object is directly mutated instead of creating a new list. Also, since both the variables `a` and `b` were pointing to the same mutable object (with the same ID), when we imposed a change on the variable `a`, it was reflected onto the variable `b` as well. This is one of the side-effects mutable objects cause, and we are going to look at some more in the following sections.

===== B. Alias and Clone

Let's look at the following example:

.*Mutability and Aliasing*
[source,python]
----
1    s1 = 'Hello World'
2    s2 = s1
3    s1 += '!!'
4    print(s1, s2)
5
6    lst1 = [1, 2, 3]
7    lst2 = lst1
8    lst1 += [4]
9    print(lst1, lst2)
----

We can see that on line 2, the string `s1` is assigned to `s2`, and on line 7, the list `lst1` is assigned to `lst2`. What do you think the output will be? Since we changed `s1`, would it be reflected on `s2`? How about for `lst1` and `lst2`?

.*Output*
----
Hello World!! Hello World
[1, 2, 3, 4] [1, 2, 3, 4]
----

We can see that changes on `s1` did not affect `s2`, but changes on `lst1` had effect on `lst2`. Why is it so? This also comes down to the mutability of these data types. Since strings are immutable, when `'!!'` was added to `s1` on line 3, a new string was created and assigned to `s1`. The original string `'Hello World'` was not changed, and therefore, no change happened to `s2`. However, since lists are mutable, on line 8, the element `4` was added to the _same_ list `lst1` was pointing to originally. And since `lst2` was also pointing to the same list, the change was reflected onto `lst2` as well.

As such, the act of assigning an already referenced object (such as lists) to another variable is called _aliasing_. For example, line 7 is an example of aliasing because two variables (`lst1` and `lst2`) are referencing the same object. This may be useful in some cases where you want a change in one object to be reflected on the other. But generally, this behavior would not be desirable. If you want multiple copies of a same list, you should consider _cloning_ it.

There are several ways to clone, or copy, lists to other variables.

.*Method 1: Use the `copy()` Method*
[source,python]
----
1    a = [1, 2, 3]
2    b = a.copy()
3    print(a, b)
4
5    a[1] = 10
6    print(a, b)
----

.*Output*
----
[1, 2, 3] [1, 2, 3]
[1, 10, 3] [1, 2, 3]
----

.*Method 2: Use Slicing*
[source,python]
----
1    a = [1, 2, 3]
2    b = a[:]
3    print(a, b)
4
5    a[1] = 10
6    print(a, b)
----

.*Output*
----
[1, 2, 3] [1, 2, 3]
[1, 10, 3] [1, 2, 3]
----

.*Method 3: Use the `list()` Function*
[source,python]
----
1    a = [1, 2, 3]
2    b = list(a)
3    print(a, b)
4
5    a[1] = 10
6    print(a, b)
----

.*Output*
----
[1, 2, 3] [1, 2, 3]
[1, 10, 3] [1, 2, 3]
----

All three methods can be used to copy over lists to other variables. However, let's look at the following example:

.*List Cloning*
[source,python]
----
1    a = [[1, 2], 3, 4]
2    b = a.copy()
3    a[0][0] = 0
4    print(a, b)
----

.*Output*
----
[[0, 2], 3, 4] [[0, 2], 3, 4]
----

In this case, the change is reflected across all instances of the list. This is because all three aforementioned methods are creating _shallow copies_ of the original list. This means that the list itself is a different object (with different IDs), but its elements may not be different. Let's look in more detail:

.*Shallow Copy (Python Shell)*
----
>>> inner = ['a', 'b']
>>> a = [inner, 'c']
>>> b = a.copy()
>>> print(a, b)
[['a', 'b'], 'c'] [['a', 'b'], 'c']
>>>
>>> id(a)
1827986301576
>>> id(b)
1827986800072
>>> id(a[0])
1827986301512
>>> id(b[0])
1827986301512
----

We can see that the IDs of the lists `a` and `b` are different, but the IDs of their first element are equal. This means that if the list contains mutable elements, changes to those elements will be reflected on other shallow copied instances of that list. Because lists are mutable, change to the list `a` under the List Cloning example also resulted in a change to the list `b`.

The cloning method that creates a different object for each element is called _deep copying_, which will not be covered right now.

[[1, 2, 3], 5] [[1, 2, 3], 4]
[5, 4] [[1, 2, 3], 4]

For the last example, list b was not changed because the nested list itself was not changed. The number 5 was simply assigned to the first index of list a.
----

<<<

=== Strings

We covered strings before but only the surface. Python has various tools to manipulate strings, so let's look at the different ways on how to do just that.

As mentioned before, strings are also iterables, which means they can be iterated through. Thus, strings share lots of similarities to lists. Strings are basically lists with each character as elements. You can actually use the `list()` function to transform strings to a character array:

----
>>> list('Hello')
['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
----

In the next section, we will cover operators, functions, and methods that can be used with strings, and you may notice that they function similarly with strings as they do with lists.

==== String Operations, Functions, and Methods

===== A. String Operators

The following are operators that can be used with strings in Python.

[%header,cols="^.^10%,^.^20%,^.^20%,50%",stripes=none]
|====
| Operator | Name | Example | Description
| `[]` | Index Operator | `str[x]` | Accesses the character at specified index
| `+` | `+` Operator | `str_a + str_b` | Concatenates the second string to the end of the first string
| `*` | `*` Operator | `str * n` | Repeats the string by the specified number of times
| `==` | Equivalence Operator | `str_a == str_b` | Checks if the two strings are equal
| `in` | Membership Operator | `char in str` | Checks if the string contains the specified character(s)
| `:` | Slice Operator | `str[x:y]` | _Slices_ the string from index `x` (inclusive) to index `y` (exclusive)
|====

You can see that the operators and their functions are almost identical for both strings and lists. Since the `+`, `*`, and `==` operators were covered in <<Chapter2.adoc#operators, Chapter 2>>, they will not be covered here. Let's look at the others one by one.

As you can see, by using the index operator, we can access a specific character at given index. The indexing system of strings are the same as lists (i.e. zero-based index) and also allows for negative indices. Therefore, since `s` is a 6-character string, the valid index range is `-6` to `5` (both inclusive).

TypeError: 'in <string>' requires string as left operand, not int
----

The `in` operator is used to check if a string contains a character or a sequence of characters. If you look at the fourth example, you can see that the case of the characters matter. Also, the last example shows that the left operand must be of type string. Although obvious, you cannot check if an integer (or any other types) is present in a string.

'erator'
>>> s[11:100]
'tor :'
----

The slice operator also functions identically for strings as they do for lists. They allow the use of negative, empty, and out of range indices. If an index is left empty or is out of range, it is defaulted to either the first or last character. You can use this operator to select a meaningful portion of the original string and assign it to a new variable.

===== B. Strings and Functions

There are not many functions that are well-used with strings, but one important function is the `len` function.

.*`len()` Examples (Python Shell)*
----
>>> len('Hello World')
11
>>> len('string')
6
>>> len('   ')
3
----

The `len` function returns the length of the string passed as the parameter. There are no exceptions or special cases to remember, just that each character adds 1 to a string's length count.

There are also the `float()`, `int()`, and `list()` functions that we covered earlier, which can be used to transform strings into floating point numbers, integers, and lists, respectively. The other functions mentioned under <<B. Lists and Functions, Section B. Lists and Functions>> can also be used with strings, with the exception of `sum()`. They would function identically to lists but would serve less importance for strings.

===== C. String Methods

There are a lot of useful methods for strings in Python that we are not going to cover all of them, but you can always go to Google to find out more. Still, there's a lot to cover, and with enough practice and use, they should come naturally to you with time. Here are some useful string methods:

[%header,cols="^.^15%,^.^25%,.^60%",stripes=none]
|====
| Method | Example | Description
| `upper()` | `s.upper()` | Converts `s` into uppercase
| `lower()` | `s.lower()` | Converts `s` into lowercase
| `startswith()` | `s.startswith(pre[, start[, end]])` | Returns `True` if `s` starts with `pre`. The range of search is narrowed from `start` to `end` (exclusive), if provided.
| `endswith()` | `s.endswith(suf[, start[, end]])` | Returns `True` if `s` ends with `suf`. The range of search is narrowed from `start` to `end` (exclusive), if provided.
| `find()` | `s.find(val[, start[, end]])` | Returns the lowest index where `val` is found in `s` within the range `start` to `end` (exclusive), if provided. If not found, returns `-1`.
| `index()` | `s.index(val[, start[, end]])` | Same as `find` but raises `ValueError` if `val` is not found.
| `split()` | `s.split([sep])` | Splits `s` using `sep` as the delimiter. If not specified, one whitespace is used as the delimiter.
| `join()` | `s.join(it)` | Joins the string(s) in the iterable `it` together with `s`
| `strip()` | `s.strip()` | Removes the leading and trailing whitespaces and newline characters of `s`
| `isalnum()` | `s.isalnum()` | Returns `True` if all characters of `s` is either a number or an alphabet and `s` contains at least one character; `False` otherwise
| `isalpha()` | `s.isalpha()` | Returns `True` if all characters of `s` is an alphabet and `s` contains at least one character; `False` otherwise
| `isnumeric()` | `s.isnumeric()` | Returns `True` if all characters of `s` is a number and `s` contains at least one character; `False` otherwise
| `replace()` | `s.replace(old, new[, count])` | Replaces all occurrences of `old` in `s` with `new`. If the optional parameter `count` is provided, only the first `count` occurrences are replaced.
| `count()` | `s.count(el[, start[, end]])` | Returns the number of occurrences of `el` in `s` within the range `start` to `end` (exclusive), if provided
| `format()` | `s.format(val...)` | Formats `s` (will be covered in more detail later)
|====

[NOTE]
All string methods returns new string values and do not change the original string (because strings are immutable)

.*`upper()` and `lower()` Examples (Python Shell)*
----
>>> 'hello world'.upper()
HELLO WORLD
>>> 'CAPS LOCK'.lower()
caps lock
>>> 'Python123'.lower()
python123
----

Both methods are pretty self-explanatory, but their use may not be. One common usage of these methods is to compare two strings, ignoring case. Let's say, for example, you want to let the user quit your program by inputting the command word `quit` in any form. In other words, `quit`, `Quit`, `qUiT`, and so on must all allow the user to quit the program. Then you can write the following in your code:

[source,python]
----
user_command = input('Command: ')
if user_command.lower() == 'quit':
    # quit the program
# or if user_command.upper() == 'QUIT':
----

Then regardless of what the user inputs, as long as it is the word `quit` (in any case), the program will quit.

Other similar methods include `capitalize()` and `title()`. `capitalize()` will convert the first character of the string into uppercase, whereas `title()` will convert the first characters of each word of the string into uppercase. Their use is situational, which is why these are not covered in detail.

True
>>> 'Learning Python'.endswith('hon')
True
>>> 'Learning Python'.endswith('ing', 0, 8)
True
----

Both methods check if a string either starts with or ends with a certain sequence of characters. The optional parameter `start` is inclusive whereas the optional parameter `end` is exclusive. Let's look at the last example. If the string [fira-code]#'Learning Python'# is sliced from index `0` to `8`, the resulting string is [fira-code]#'Learning'#. Since it ends with [fira-code]#'ing'#, the method returns `True`. The second example also shows that the method is case-sensitive.

>>> 'blue glue'.find('B')
-1
>>> 'blue glue'.index('B')
...
ValueError: substring not found
>>> 'blue glue'.find('ue')
2
>>> 'blue glue'.find('ue', 3)
7
>>> 'blue glue'.find('ue', 3, 8')
-1
----

The performance of the two methods are completely identical until the substring is not found in the string. Then, as the third and fourth examples show, `find()` returns `-1` whereas `index()` raises a `ValueError`.

The last three examples show how the slice ranges can affect the search. For the third to last, since the _first_ appearance of `'ue'` in the string is in the word `'blue'`, the index `2` is returned. In the second to last example, the string is sliced from index `3` to the end, resulting in `'e glue'`. As a result, the first occurrence of the string `'ue'` is at index `7`. In the last example, since the string is sliced from index `3` to `8` (exclusive), the result is `e glu`. Therefore, there is no occurrence of the string `'ue'`, and `-1` is returned.

Also, both methods have a second form, `rfind()` and `rindex()`. These two methods take in the same parameters as their original counterparts but tries to find the _last_ occurrence of the substring inside the string (instead of the first). Look at the following example to get a better understanding:

----
>>> 'blue glue'.find('ue')
2
>>> 'blue glue'.rfind('ue')
7
----

Using `index()` and `rindex()` will have the same outcome in this case (may be different in other cases).

>>> ' + '.join('letters')
'l + e + t + t + e + r + s'
>>> '   padded    '.strip()
'padded'
>>> '\nNewline\n\n'.strip()
'Newline'
----

First, let's look at `split()`. In the first and second examples, since no parameter was provided, the method split the string by one whitespace. Consecutive whitespaces are counted as one by Python, which is why `'three{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}spaces'` was split into `['three', 'spaces']` instead of `['three', '', '', 'spaces']`. The next examples split the string using the parameter provided as the delimiter string.

The `join()` method joins each element in the iterable provided together with the string associated with the method. Since a string is also an iterable (consisting of each character as each element), the second to last example joined each letter of the string with the delimiter string `' + '`.

The `strip()` method will remove leading and trailing whitespaces and newline characters from the string. Like `find()` and `index()`, this method also has alternative forms in `lstrip()` and `rstrip()`. `lstrip()` (left strip) and `rstrip()` (right strip) will remove leading and trailing whitespaces and newline characters, respectively.

These three methods are also self-explanatory. Remember that for all three methods, empty strings and any string with whitespaces will cause the methods to return `False`.

In addition, Python provides two more methods to check if a string contains only numbers: `isdecimal()` and `isdigit()`. These two and `isnumeric()` have slight differences when managing specific Unicode characters, but for us, all three can be used interchangeably more or less.

>>> s = 'aaabbaaa'
>>> s.count('a')
6
>>> s.count('a', 4)
3
>>> s.count('a', 2, 6)
2
----

The `replace()` method will replace _all_ occurrences of given string with the new string. In the first `replace` example, we are telling the interpreter to replace all occurrences of the string `'a'` with `'c'`, so the resulting string is `'ccccc'`. In the second example, we want to replace `'aa'` with `'c'`. Since the interpreter replaces from lowest index to highest, `s` is replaced in the following steps: `'aaaaa'` -> `'caaa'` -> `'cca'`. The third example wants the interpreter to replace the _first_ two appearances of `'a'` with `'c'`, which is why the resulting string is `'ccaaa'`.

The `count()` method will return the number of appearances of the string passed as parameter in the original string. You can also pass optional `start` and `end` parameters to define the range of search. In the second `count` example, the parameter `4` is assigned to `start`, which ultimately slices the string from index `4` to the end. This results in `s` being sliced to `baaa`, which contains 3 ``'a'``s. In the last `count` example, `s` is sliced from index `2` to `6` (exclusive), resulting in `'abba'`, and there are 2 ``'a'``s.

====== String Formatting

String formatting is a simple method of combining different values with strings. Remember when we wanted to combine integers and strings, we had to use the `str()` function to convert the integer into a string first, like the following example:

.*Example 1: With `str` Function*
[source,python]
----
1    age = 15
2    print('I am ' + str(age) + ' years old')
3    # prints 'I am 15 years old'
----

However, with string formatting, we can do this in an easier and more elegant way. To do this, we make use of the `format()` method.

*Basic Formatting*

The idea of string formatting is that we provide a placeholder in a string where we want to insert a certain value. Let's see how we would achieve the previous example with string formatting:

.*Example 1: With String Formatting*
[source,python]
----
1    age = 15
2    print('I am {} years old'.format(age))
3    # prints 'I am 15 years old'
----

In this example, the curly braces `{}` serve as the placeholder for the variable `age`. Ultimately, the value `15` is inserted into where the curly braces `{}` are. Let's look at more examples to get a better understanding:

.*More String Formatting Examples (Python Shell)*
----
>>> '{} + {} = {}'.format('abc', 'def', 'abcdef')
'abc + def = abcdef'
>>> '{} + {} = {}'.format(1, 2, 3)
'1 + 2 = 3'
>>> 'I am {}, and my brother is {}'.format(15, 13)
'I am 15, and my brother is 13'
>>> print('First Name: {}\nLast Name: {}'.format('Jane', 'Doe'))
First Name: Jane
Last Name: Doe
----

You can also use indices to determine the placement of each parameter.

.*More String Formatting Examples (Python Shell) (Cont.)*
----
>>> '{1} {0}'.format(2, 3)
3 2
>>> '{2}, {1}, {0}'.format('Calvin', 'Bob', 'Alice')
'Alice, Bob, Calvin'
>>> '{0} {1} {1} {1}'.format('one', 'two')
'one two two two'
----

Remember that indices start from `0`. This method can be useful if you want to repeat a certain value multiple times, like the last example did.

*Named Placeholders*

This is similar to using indices except we give each parameter its own unique name.

.*Named Placeholder Examples (Python Shell)*
----
>>> '{one} {two}'.format(one='Hello', two='World')
'Hello World'
>>> 'I read {title}'.format(title='Harry Potter')
'I read Harry Potter'
>>> print('Name: {name}\nAge: {age}'.format(name='John Doe', age=15))
Name: John Doe
Age: 15
----

You specify a _name_, or a _specifier_, you want to use inside the curly braces `{}`. Then, you use a variable with the same name inside the parentheses of the `format()` function to pass along with the parameter value. In the first example, we use two specifiers: `one` and `two`. Inside the parentheses, we assign `'Hello'` to the variable `one` and `'World'` to the variable `two`. Then, the value of the variable with matching name is inserted into the corresponding named placeholder, resulting in the string `'Hello World'`.

This method is useful because it is clear what the value stands for. In the second example, by looking at the specifier, we can tell that a title of a book (or a magazine, etc.) is going to be formatted into the string.

This is probably all you have to know for now. There are lots of more ways to manipulate strings and numbers, such as padding, truncating, and aligning, which you can learn more about online.

=== Tuples

Tuples are additional data structures in Python. While they might not be used as prominently as lists or other data types, they have their uses. Tuples are very similar to lists, except they are immutable. First, let's look at how we can define a tuple.

==== Creating Tuples

To define a tuple, we use parentheses (`()`) instead of square brackets (`[]`) like we do for lists. Also, just like lists, a tuple can contain values of different types.

.*Tuple Assignment*
[source,python]
----
 1    a = (1, 2, 3, 'Hello World')
 2    print(a)
 3
 4    # To create an empty tuple, use the tuple() function
 5    empty_tuple = tuple()  # empty_tuple = ()
 6    print(empty_tuple)
 7
 8    # To create a tuple with one element, leave a comma
 9    b = ('abc',)
10    print(b)
----

.*Output*
----
(1, 2, 3, 'Hello World')
('abc',)
()
----

As shown in lines 4-6, to create an empty tuple, you can use the `tuple()` function with no parameters or just empty parentheses. Also, as shown in lines 8-10, to create a tuple with one element, we leave a trailing comma after the first element. This is because if we do not, the interpreter will interpret the line as just a value in a parentheses operator instead of a tuple. For example,

[%noheader,grid="none",frame="none",cols=2]
|====
a|
----
>>> a = (1 + 2)
>>> a
3
>>> type(a)
<class 'int'>
----
a|
----
>>> t = (1 + 2,)
>>> t
(3,)
>>> type(t)
<class 'tuple'>
----
|====

You can also create tuples without using parentheses, which is called _tuple packing_.

.*Tuple Packing*
[source,python]
----
1    t1 = 1, 2, 3, 'Hello World'
2    print(t1)
3
4    t2 = 'abc',

==== Accessing Tuple Elements

We can use the square brackets (`[]`) as index operators to access a tuple's elements.

.*Tuple Indices (Python Shell)*
----
>>> a = (1, 2, 3, 4, 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
>>> print(a[0], a[3], a[7])
1 4 d
>>> print(a[-8], a[-5], a[-1])
1 4 d
>>> a[:]
(1, 2, 3, 4, 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
>>> a[2:5]
(3, 4, 'a')
----

Just like lists, we can use positive and negative indices to access elements and the slice operator to create a copy of a range of the original tuple. However, unlike lists, we cannot use the index operator to change a tuple element because a tuple is, as mentioned earlier, immutable.

==== Tuple Operations, Functions, and Methods

[discrete]
===== A. Tuple Operators

The following are operators that can be used with tuples in Python.

[%header,cols="^.^10%,^.^20%,^.^20%,50%",stripes=none]
|====
| Operator | Name | Example | Description
| `[]` | Index Operator | `t[x]` | Accesses the element at specified index
| `+` | `+` Operator | `t1 + t2` | Concatenates the second tuple to the end of the first tuple
| `*` | `*` Operator | `t * n` | Repeats the tuple by the `n` times
| `==` | Equivalence Operator | `t1 == t2` | Checks if the two tuples are equal
| `in` | Membership Operator | `el in t` | Checks if the tuple `t` contains the specified element `el`
| `:` | Slice Operator | `t[x:y]` | _Slices_ the tuple from index `x` (inclusive) to index `y` (exclusive)
|====

Since the index and slice operators were shown in the previous section, here, we will cover the other operators.

.*`+` Operator Further Example (Python Shell)*
----
>>> (1, 2, 3) + (4,)
(1, 2, 3, 4)
>>> t1, t2 = ('a', 'b'), ('c', 'd')
>>> t1 + t2
('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
----

The plus (`+`) operator will combine the two tuples and return a new tuple. Because tuples are immutable, the original two tuples are used but not changed to create a _new_ tuple with a different ID (`id()`) than the original two.

.*`pass:q[*]` Operator Further Example (Python Shell)*
----
>>> (1, 2, 3) * 3
(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)
>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd') * 2
>>> t
('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
----

Similar to the plus operator, if you use the `*` operator on a tuple, the resulting tuple is a _new_ tuple with a different ID (`id()`) than the original tuple.

.*`==` Operator Further Example (Python Shell)*
----
>>> ('a', 'b', 'c') == ('a', 'b', 'c')
True
>>> (1, 2, 3) == (2, 1, 3)
False
>>> ('a',) == ('A',)
False
----

Like lists and strings, two tuples are considered equal (i.e. `==` evaluates to `True`) if all elements are equal and in the same order. For the second example, because the elements are equal but not in the same order, `==` evaluates to `False`. For the last example, because the letters are in different cases, the operation yields `False`.

.*`in` Operator Further Example (Python Shell)*
----
>>> 'el' in ('a', 'b', 'el')
True
>>> '1' in (1, 2, 3)
False
----

For the `in` operator to yield `True`, the tuple must contain an element that is equal to the value being searched. In other words, if we write the operation in the form of `x in tup`, the operation will yield `True` if and only if the tuple `tup` contains an element `el` that causes `el == x` to evaluate to `True`.

For the first example, assuming `t = ('a', 'b', 'el')`, since `'el' == t[2]` evaluates to `True`, the `in` operator also yields `True`. For the second example, since there is no such element in the tuple, the `in` operator returns `False`.

True
False  # -> True if ((3, 6), 9)
----

[discrete]
===== B. Tuples and Functions

Here are some functions that can take tuples as parameters.

[%header,cols="^.^15%,^.^25%,60%",stripes=none]
|====
| Function | Example | Description
| `len()` | `len(t)` | Returns the length of tuple `t`
| `max()` | `max(t)` | Returns the maximum element of tuple `t`
| `min()` | `min(t)` | Returns the minimum element of tuple `t`
| `sorted()` | `sorted(t)` | Returns the sorted version of tuple `t` as a _list_
| `sum()` | `sum(t)` | Returns the sum of all elements of tuple `t`
| `list()` | `list(t)` | Converts `t` into a list
|====

The usage and function of these functions are identical to that of lists.

.*Function Examples (Python Shell)*
----
>>> a = (2, 1, 4, 3)
>>> len(a)
4
>>> max(a)
4
>>> min(a)
1
>>> sorted(a)
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> sum(a)
10
>>> max((1, 2, 'a', 'b'))
...
TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
----

Remember that `max()`, `min()`, and `sorted()` functions can only be used on tuples that contain elements that can all be compared with each other. For example, if a tuple contains both integers and strings, using these functions will cause the interpreter to raise an exception. Also, the `sum()` function can only be used on tuples that contain only numerical elements.

Although these functions can take tuples as parameters, you most likely would not need to use them besides the `len()` function.

.*`list()` Examples (Python Shell)*
----
>>> t1 = (1, 2, 3)
>>> list(t1)
[1, 2, 3]
>>> list(('a, 'b', 1, 2))
['a', 'b', 1, 2]
>>> tuple([1, 2, 3])
(1, 2, 3)
----

The `list()` function can be used to convert a tuple, or any iterables, into a list with same elements. Similarly, the `tuple()` can be used to convert a list, or any iterables, to a tuple with same elements.

[discrete]
===== C. Tuple Methods

Just like functions, the tuple methods' uses and functions are identical to that of lists and strings.

[%header,cols="^.^15%,^.^25%,60%",stripes=none]
|====
| Method | Example | Description
| `count()` | `a.count(el)` | Returns the number of appearances of `el` in tuple `a`
| `index()` | `a.index(el[, start[, end]])` | Returns the lowest index of `el` in tuple `a`. You can also designate a range of search by passing in the optional `start` and `end` parameters.
|====

.*Tuple Method Examples (Python Shell)*
----
>>> a = (1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 'a', 'b', True)
>>> a.count(1)
3
>>> a.index(1)
0
>>> a.index(1, 1)
3
>>> a.index(1, 4, 7)
4
>>> a.index('c')
...
ValueError: tuple.index(x): x not in tuple
----

Notice that for the `index()` method, the result changes depending on the range of search. Also, if the element is not in the tuple when using the `index()` method, the interpreter will raise a `ValueError`.

==== Tuples and Lists Differences
// https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/python-tuples-and-tuple-methods-4817a6bb6fff

The biggest difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable, while lists are mutable. This means, as mentioned before, you cannot change an element of an existing tuple. Also, if you add two tuples via the plus operator, the resulting tuple will be a new one with a different ID. Let's see some examples:

----
>>> t1, t2 = (1, 2), (3, 4)
>>> new_t = t1 + t2
>>> new_t
(1, 2, 3, 4)
>>> id(t1)
2714843084296
>>> id(t2)
2714844616584
>>> id(new_t)
2714844602520
>>> new_t[0] = 10
...
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
----

We can see that the IDs of all three tuples are different. Once tuples are defined, it is final, which means you cannot make any more changes. Therefore, it is better to use tuples over lists when you know you will not be changing their values. One example is creating a variable to represent a color. One of many ways to represent a color with a computer is the RGB value, which stands for red-green-blue. In this case, you should use a tuple to hold the RGB value instead of a list.

[source,python]
----
1    COLOR_WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
2    COLOR_BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
----

Another use of tuples is to group related information together. For example, you can use a tuple to represent a student (and their information) and a list to represent a class (of students).

[source,python]
----
1    class_201 = [
2        ('Alice', 'F',  92),
3        ('Bob',   'M',  87),
4        ('Cate',  'F', 100),
5        ('Dan',   'M',  74)
6    ]
----

In the above example, the list refers to all the students of classroom 201, and each tuple represents a single student, containing their name, gender, and test score.

Since tuples are final once they are created, using tuples may sometimes be faster than using lists, but we will not go into detail. For now, you could use lists to accomplish what tuples can, but later on, you may need to differentiate their uses to increase efficiency.

<<<

=== Dictionaries

Dictionaries are the last data structure in Python that we will be covering in this chapter. Dictionaries are a unique data structure in that they can use specific values to access its elements. For example, they can be used to map the relationship between people's IDs and passwords, which is why they are sometimes referred to as _maps_ as well. Let's see how to utilize them in the following sections.

==== Using Dictionaries

You may have noticed a pattern when creating iterable data structures. Lists used square brackets (`[]`) and tuples used parentheses (`()`). Similarly, dictionaries can be created using the curly braces (`{}`). Remember that dictionaries map the relationship between two values. Let's look at an example to better understand this:

.*Using Dictionaries*
[source,python]
----
1    author_book_map = {
2        'Shakespeare'   : 'Romeo and Juliet',
3        'J.K. Rowling'  : 'Harry Potter',
4        'George Orwell' : '1984'
5    }
6
7    empty_dict = dict()  # or empty_dict = {}
----

In this example, the dictionary `author_book_map` maps the relationship between an author and his/her book. In this case, we call the author, the _key_, and the book, the _value_. As such, we say that a dictionary has a key-value pairing (to be written as KV pairing henceforth).

We can also create an empty dictionary using the `dict()` function with no parameters or just by using empty curly braces.

To access the values of dictionaries, we can use the keys with the index operator (`[]`). Because we use keys to access values, the keys of a dictionary must be unique. There cannot be two of the same keys in one dictionary.

.*Using Dictionaries (Cont.)*
[source,python]
----
 8    print(author_book_map)
 9    print(author_book_map['J.K. Rowling'])
10    print(author_book_map['George Orwell'])
----

.*Output*
----
{'Shakespeare': 'Romeo and Juliet', 'J.K. Rowling': 'Harry Potter', 'George Orwell': '1984'}
Harry Potter
1984
----

Similarly, we can create new entries or update existing KV pairs in similar fashion.

.*Using Dictionaries (Cont.)*
[source,python]
----
11    # Create new entries
12    empty_dict['A'] = 1
13    empty_dict['B'] = 2
14
15    # Update exsiting entries
16    author_book_map['George Orwell'] = 'Animal Farm'
17
18    print(empty_dict)
19    print(author_book_map)
----

.*Output*
----
{'A': 1, 'B', 2}
{'Shakespeare': 'Romeo and Juliet', 'J.K. Rowling': 'Harry Potter', 'George Orwell': 'Animal Farm'}
----

The key takeaway is that instead of using the zero-based indexing system, dictionaries use the _keys_ to access the _values_.

.#*Exercise 3.32: Write your own program*#

        key2 : capital2
        key3 : capital3
        ...

Q3. Add one more entry to the existing dictionary.

13
14    # Q3
15    cntry2cap['Japan'] = 'Tokyo'
16    print(cntry2cap)  # check with print() statement

==== Dictionary Operations, Functions, and Methods

===== A. Dictionary Operations

Here are the operators that can be used with dictionaries.

[%header,cols="^.^10%,^.^20%,^.^20%,50%",stripes=none]
|====
| Operator | Name | Example | Description
| `[]` | Index Operator | `d[key]` | Accesses the value with the specified key
| `==` | Equivalence Operator | `d1 == d2` | Checks if the two dictionaries are equal
| `in` | Membership Operator | `key in d` | Checks if the dictionary `d` contains the specified `key`
| `del` | `del` Operator | `del d[key]` | Deletes the KV pair with specified `key` from the dictionary `d`
|====

Because we have covered the index operator, we will go over the others in this section.

.*Operators Example (Python Shell)*
----
>>> d1 = {'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 3}
>>> d2 = {'B': 2, 'C': 3, 'A': 1}
>>> d1 == d2
True
>>> d1 == {'A': 2, 'B': 2, 'C': 3}
False
>>> 'A' in d1
True
>>> 1 in d1
False
>>> del d1['A']
>>> d1
{'B': 2, 'C': 3}
----

Two dictionaries are considered equal if and only if they have the same KV pairs. The order does not matter because, as mentioned earlier, dictionaries inherently do not maintain a set order of its elements. The mapping between keys and values of both `d1` and `d2` are equal. Therefore, using the equivalence operator on the two dictionaries yield `True`. However, in the second `==` example, the right hand dictionary contains the `'A': 2` pair, which `d1` does not have. Therefore, the operation yields `False`.

The `in` operator will check if the dictionary contains the mentioned _key_, not the value. Therefore, `'A' in d1` yields `True` because `'A'` is a key. On the other hand, `1 in d1` yields `False` because `1` is a value (of the KV pair). It is also possible to use `not` with the `in` operator.

The `del` operator will delete the KV pair with specified key. It is similar to how it works with lists. This shows that dictionaries are mutable just like lists are. It is possible to add, delete, and update KV pairs of a dictionary without creating a new one (in the computer's memory).

===== B. Dictionaries and Functions

[%header,cols="^.^15%,^.^25%,60%",stripes=none]
|====
| Function | Example | Description
| `len()` | `len(d)` | Returns the length of dictionary `d`
| `list()` | `list(d)` | Returns a list of all the keys of dictionary `d`
| `max()` | `max(d)` | Returns the maximum element of the keys of dictionary `d`
| `min()` | `min(d)` | Returns the minimum element of the keys of dictionary `d`
| `sorted()` | `sorted(d)` | Returns the sorted _list_ of the keys of dictionary `d`
| `sum()` | `sum(d)` | Returns the sum of all elements of the keys of dictionary `d`
|====

These functions operate only on the _keys_ of a dictionary. However, you would almost never need to use these functions with dictionaries except for the `len()` and `list()` function. Like lists and tuples, the function yields the length of the dictionary. You can think of it as the number of KV pairs, or simply as the number of keys.

.*`len()` and `list()` Further Examples (Python Shell)*
----
>>> len(dict())
0
>>> d1, d2 = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}, {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [4, 5, 6]}
>>> len(d1)
3
>>> len(d2)
2
>>> list(d1)
[1, 2, 3]
>>> list(d2)
['a', 'b']
----

===== C. Dictionary Methods

These are some of the well-used dictionary methods.

[%header,cols="^.^15%,^.^25%,60%",stripes=none]
|====
| Method | Example | Description
| `clear()` | `d.clear()` | Deletes all KV pairs of dictionary `d`
| `copy()` | `d.copy()` | Returns a shallow copy of dictionary `d`
| `get()` | `d.get(key[, val])` | Returns the value with specified `key`. The optional parameter `val` is the default value to return if `d` does not contain `key`.
| `pop()` | `d.pop(key[, val])` | Removes and returns the value with specified `key`. The optional parameter `val` is the default value to return if `d` does not contain `key`.
| `setdefault()` | `d.setdefault(key[, val])` | If `key` exists in `d`, returns its value. If not, create a new KV pair in `d` with key `key` and value `val` and return `val`. `val` is defaulted to `None`.
|====

.*`clear()` Further Examples (Python Shell)*
----
>>> d = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}
>>> d
{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}
>>> d.clear()
>>> d
{}
>>> d = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}
>>> del d
>>> d
...
NameError: name 'd' is not defined
----

Using the `clear()` method will delete all the _KV pairs_ of the associated dictionary. The difference between `clear()` and `del` is that the `del` operator will delete the dictionary itself, rather than its elements. The above example shows the difference in action. After you delete the dictionary, using the `del` operator, if you try to call the original dictionary variable, the interpreter will raise an exception because that variable does not exist anymore. On the other hand, if you call the variable after using the `clear()` method, it will yield an empty dictionary (`{}`).

.*`copy()` Further Examples (Python Shell): Values are immutable*
----
>>> d1 = {'first': 'John', 'last': 'Doe'}
>>> d2 = d1.copy()
>>> print(d1, d2)
{'first': 'John', 'last': 'Doe'} {'first': 'John', 'last': 'Doe'}
>>> id(d1) == id(d2)
False
>>> d1['first'] = 'Jane'
>>> print(d1, d2)
{'first': 'Jane', 'last': 'Doe'} {'first': 'John', 'last': 'Doe'}
----

.*`copy()` Further Examples (Python Shell): Values are mutable*
----
>>> d1 = {1: [1, 2, 3]}
>>> d2 = d1.copy()
>>> print(d1, d2)
{1: [1, 2, 3]} {1: [1, 2, 3]}
>>> d1[1][0] = 10
>>> print(d1, d2)
{1: [10, 2, 3]} {1: [10, 2, 3]}
----

The `copy()` method will return a shallow copy of the associated dictionary. As covered earlier, this means the resulting dictionary will have a differed ID from the original, but the elements may have the same ID. If we look at the second half of the previous example, both `d1` and `d2` have a KV pair that points to the same list object, `[1, 2, 3]`. This is why when we impose a change on `d1`, it is reflected on `d2` as well.

.*`get()` and `pop()` Further Examples (Python Shell)*
----
>>> d = {'a': 3, 'b': 1, 'n': 2}  # 'banana'
>>> d.get('a')
3
>>> print(d.get('c'))
None
>>> d.get('c', -1)
-1
>>> d
{'a': 3, 'b': 1, 'n': 2}
>>> d.pop('n')
2
>>> d
{'a': 3, 'b': 1}
>>> d.pop('n')
KeyError: 'n'
>>> d.pop('n', -1)
-1
----

Both `get()` and `pop()` will return the value associated with given key. The difference is that `pop()` will remove the KV pair with given key. Another difference between the two methods is that if the optional parameter `val` is not specified for `get()` and key does not exist in dictionary, `None` is returned. In the previous example, after the third input line (`>>>`), since `d` does not have a key `'c'`, `None` is returned and printed. However, if the optional parameter `val` is not specified for `pop()` and key does not exist, the interpreter will raise an exception, namely `KeyError`.

The optional parameter `val` can be used to give additional meaningful information. If you have not noticed already, the keys of `d` were the unique letters of the string `'banana'`, and the values were the count of those letters in the string. In the fourth input line, `-1` was passed as the optional parameter `val`. So if the method outputs a `-1`, we know that `d` does not contain such key. Since the value associated with each key is the _number_ of appearances of that key in the string `'banana'`, getting `-1`, a _number_, makes much more sense than getting `None` as the output.

.*`setdefault()` Further Examples (Python Shell): `key` not in dict*
----
>>> d = {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30}
>>> print(d.setdefault(4))
None
>>> d
{1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: None}
>>> d.setdefault(5, 50)
50
>>> d
{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: None, 5: 50}
----

If `key` is not in the associated dictionary when using the `setdefault()` method, the method will create a new KV pair with given key and return `val`. If the optional parameter `val` is provided, it will become the value of given `key`. If not, `None` will be assigned as value of given `key`. Then that value is returned.

In `d.setdefault(4)`, since `val` was not specified, `None` was set as the value of the key `4`, and `None` was returned. After `d.setdefault(5, 50)` was called, because `val` was specified, `50` was assigned as value of key `5` and returned.

.*`setdefault()` Further Examples (Python Shell): `key` in dict*
----
>>> d = {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30}

== Chapter 4 - Conditional Statements

Conditional, also known as branching statements, can be used to allow your program make decisions based on certain conditions...but what does this mean? Let's look at an example.

Let's look at the decisions you might make during your typical day.

[%header, cols="<.^50%,<.^50%"]
|====
^| *Condition* ^| *Action*
| If you are hungry | Then you eat food
| If you are thirsty | Then you drink water
| If you have homework | Then you finish your homework
| If you are bored | Then you play games
| If you are tired | Then you go to sleep
|====

As shown above, based on some conditions, the actions you may take are different. However, what if you are bored _and_ have homework? What will you do? To account for such situations, you need to establish a more concrete set of conditions. As such, it is essential to come up with appropriate conditions and the actions that follow.

=== _if_ Statements

An _if_ statement in Python has the following structure:

.*Structure of an `if` Statement*
[source,python]
----
1    if <condition>:
2        <action>
----

The part indicated by `<condition>` must be a boolean value, variable holding a boolean value, or an expression that evaluates to a boolean value, and the part marked as `<action>` can be anything, ranging from variable assignments to writing `print()` statements. `<action>` is executed if and only if `<condition>` evaluates to the boolean value `True`. For example:

.*Boolean Expression*
[source,python]
----
1    x = 5
2    y = 10
3
4    if x > y:  # False
5        print('x is greater than y')
6    if x < y:  # True
7        print('x is less than y')
----

.*Output*
----
x is less than y
----

Let's take a look at the example line by line.

* At lines 1-2, the interpreter creates two variables, `x` and `y`.
* At line 4, the interpreter evaluates the expression inside the _if_ statement, and we can see that `x > y` evaluates to `False`.
* Since the condition evaluates to `False`, the interpreter *does not* read line 5 and *skips* to line 6. For any _if_ statement, if the condition evaluates to `False`, the interpreter will skip the _if_ block and go straight to the next section.
* At line 6, the condition evaluates to `True`. Therefore, the interpreter will enter the block and read line 7, thus printing `x is less than y` on the CLI.

Hence, only line 7 is executed.

Also, a crucial part to note is that codes you write for the `<action>` section must be one indent rightward compared to the `<condition>` statement. For example:

.*Indentation Example 1*
[source,python]
----
1    if is_hungry:
2        print('Get up')
3        print('Go to kitchen')
4        print('Cook food')
5        print('Eat food')
----

In the above example, lines 2-5 would be executed if the variable `is_hungry` is holding the boolean value `True`. It is different, however, to the next example.

.*Indentation Example 2*
[source,python]
----
1    if is_hungry:
2        print('Get up')
3        print('Go to kitchen')
4        print('Cook food')
5    print('Eat food')
----

In this example, lines 2-4 would be executed if `is_hungry` is `True`. However, line 5 would be executed regardless of the boolean value that is stored in `is_hungry`.

If `is_hungry` is `False`:

=== _else_ and _elif_ Statements

_else_ and _elif_ (short for _else if_) statements are used when we want to designate an _action_ for the program to take when the condition for _if_ statement is not taken. Hence, they are also referred to as _alternative executions_.

.*Alternative Branches Structure*
[source,python]
----
if <cond1>:
    <action1>
elif <cond2>:
    <action2>
else:
    <action3>
----

`<action1>` (_if_ block) is executed if and only if: ::
`<cond1>` evaluates to `True`

`<action2>` (_elif_ block) is executed if and only if: ::
`<cond1>` evaluates to `False`, *and* `<cond2>` evaluates to `True`

`<action3>` (_else_ block) is executed if and only if: ::
`<cond1>` and `<cond2>` both evaluate to `False`

====
This means that the above is equivalent to writing:

[source,python]
----
if <cond1>:
    <action1>
if <not cond1 and cond2>:
    <action2>
if <not cond1 and not cond2>:
    <action3>
----

This may seem trivial at first, but it is crucial that you understand this concept well to correctly utilize _if_ statements in larger programs.
====

So suppose that `<cond1>` evaluates to `True`:

* The interpreter moves to line 1 and sees that condition is `True`. So it moves to line 2 and executes `<action1>`.
* Since the _if_ block was entered, the interpreter skips the corresponding `elif` and `else` blocks. Hence, none of `<action2>` or `<action3>` is executed.

Likewise, in the chain of conditional statements, if the interpreter enters one block, it will skip all the subsequent blocks. This is an example of _short-circuiting_ and will be covered <<short-circuit,below>>.

.*Chained Conditionals Example*
[source,python]
----
Evaluate the output of the following program:

 1    x, y = 5, 10
 2    if x < y:
 3        print('This is the if block')
 4        print('x < y')
 5    elif x <= y:
 6        print('This is the elif block')
 7        print('x <= y')
 8    else:
 9        print('This is the else block')
10        print('x >= y')
----

.*Output*
----
This is the if block
x < y
----

Even though both `x < y` (line 2) and `x \<= y` (line 4) are true, since the interpreter enters the _if_ block first, the _elif_ block is skipped and thus, not executed.

====
[[short-circuit]]
*Short-Circuiting*

Short-circuiting is the act of terminating an operation or a check prematurely for optimization purposes. Remember that in a chain of _if-elif-else_ statements, if one block is entered, Python will _prematurely terminate_ the condition checks of the rest of the _if_ statements and skip over to the next section.

Let's look at the following example:

.*short_circuit.py*
[source,python]
----
1    x, y = 5, 10
2
3    if x < y:  # True
4        print('if-block is entered')
5    elif what_is_this:  # not checked
6        print('This condition is not checked')
----

.*Output*
----
if-block is entered
----

Even though we do not have a variable named `what_is_this`, the Python interpreter does not raise an exception when we execute the program. This blatantly shows that since the condition in the _if_ statement on line 3 was `True`, the interpreter executed the action in line 4 and skipped over the rest of the chain. Although you should not do something like this in your program, this example effectively shows what _short-circuiting_ is doing.

   * C (70 <= grade < 80)
   * D (60 <= grade < 70)
   * F ( 0 <= grade < 60)

Assume user input is always correct.
----

.*#Answer#*

 1    grade = int(input("Enter student's score (0-100): "))
 2    if grade <= 100 and grade >= 90:
 3        print('A')
 4    elif grade >= 80:
 5        print('B')
 6    elif grade >= 70:
 7        print('C')
 8    elif grade >= 60:
 9        print('D')
10    else:
11       print('F')
----

=== Nested If Statements

It is possible to use _if_ statements inside an _if_ statement, which is called a _nested if_ statement.

.*Nested _if_ Statement*
[source,python]
----
if <cond>:
    <action1>
else:
    if <inner_cond>:
        <action2>
    else:
        <action3>
----

The two inner _if-else_ blocks will be reached if and only if `<cond>` evaluates to `False`.

This would be the same as writing:

.*Chained _if_ Statement*
[source,python]
----
if <cond>:
    <action1>
elif <inner_cond>:
    <action2>
else:
    # Or elif <not cond and not inner_cond>:
    <action4>
----

As you can see, the second example has only one level of indentation, while the first had two levels. Whenever appropriate, the second method is preferred. However, in some cases, the first example may be more readable and useful to group certain conditions together. For example, look at the following case:

[%noheader,grid="none",frame="none",cols="^.^65%,<.^35%"]
|====
a|
image::ch3_nested_if1.png[]
a|
[source,python]
----
if has_hw:
    if is_urgent:
        do_hw()
    else:
        relax()
else:
    if likes_outdoors:
        play_sports()
    else:
        play_vgames()
----

a|
image::ch3_nested_if2.png[]
a|
[source,python]
----
if has_hw and is_urgent:
    do_hw()
elif has_hw and not is_urgent:
    relax()
elif not has_hw and likes_outdoors:
    play_sports()
else:
    play_vgames()
----
|====

The first image is a depiction of a nested _if_ statement, while the second image is a depiction of a chained _if_ statement. In this case, the first image is much more readable and easy to understand than the second. If we were to write a chained _if_ statement, we would have to check the condition `has_hw` twice (first in line 1 and second in line 3). As such, you should avoid nested __if__s when possible but use them when appropriate.

[[if-data-types]]
=== *Challenge:* _if_ and Different Data Types

In Python, all values of every data type correspond to a boolean value.

[%header,cols="^.^50%,^.^50%"]
|====
| Value | Corresponding Boolean Value
| `None` .8+| `False`
| `0` (`int`)
| `0.0` (`float`)
| `''` (`str`)
| `False` (`bool`)
| `[]` (`list`)
| `()` (`tuple`)
| `{}` (`dict`)
| The rest | `True`
|====

[NOTE]
[small]#The keyword `None` represents a null value (different to `0`, `0.0`, `''`, etc). Any variable with a `None` value is essentially empty and void.#

Such values evaluate to their corresponding boolean value when used with the keywords `if`, `elif`, `else`, and `not`, and the Python function `bool()`. You can memorize this by remembering that all the "_empty_" values of each data type corresponds to `False`, and the rest is `True`.

.*Examples*
[source,python]
----
 1    empty_int, empty_float, empty_str = 0, 0.0, ''
 2    empty_list, empty_tup, empty_dict = [], (), {}
 3
 4    print(bool(empty_int))
 5    print(not empty_float)
 6    if not empty_str:
 7        print('str is empty!')
 8    if not empty_list:
 9        print('list is empty!')
10    if not empty_tup:
11        print('tuple is empty!')
12    if not empty_dict:
13        print('dictionary is empty!')
----

.*Output*
----
False
True
str is empty!
list is empty!
tuple is empty!
dictionary is empty!
----

As such, this property can be used to check if an _iterable_ is empty (i.e. does not contain any elements/characters), just like the example did with the if-statements.

=== *Challenge:* Short-Circuiting of Logical Expressions

[NOTE]
Short-circuiting was explained briefly before in <<short-circuit, this section>>.

Remember logical expressions? They are expressions with logical operators, which, in Python, are `and`, `or`, and `not`.

To briefly recap, `and` and `or` are binary operators, which means they operate on two operands, and `not` is a unary operator, which means it has one operand. The `and` operator evaluates to `True` if both operands are `True`, and on the contrary, the `or` operator evaluates to `False` if both operands are `False`.

In other words, if _any one_ of the operands of the `and` operator is `False`, the expression will evaluate to `False`. Likewise, if _any one_ of the operands of the `or` operator is `True`, the expression will evaluate to `True`. How can we use this information to optimize the speed of the `and` and `or` operations?

Let's look at the following example:

.*Short-Circuiting of Logical Expressions*
[source,python]
----
1    # 1 / 0 -> division by zero should cause Python to raise an exception
2    print(False and 1 / 0)
3    print(True or 1 / 0)
----

.*Output*

First of all, for any logical operators, the operands must be of a boolean type (which `1 / 0` is not), and second of all, `1 / 0` is dividing by zero, which should cause Python to raise the `ZeroDivisionError` (Try it out yourself on Python shell!). So judging by these facts, Python should have raised an exception when we tried to execute the previous program, but why were `False` and `True` printed without any problem?

This is because Python exhibits a behavior called short-circuiting when performing logical operations, which means the interpreter _prematurely terminates_ the evaluation of logical expressions on certain occasions.

For an `and` expression (like line 2),

* *If* the first operand evaluates to `False`
* *Then* no matter what the boolean value of the second operand is, the expression will evaluate to `False`

Therefore, Python skips the evaluation of the second operand all together.

For an `or` expression (like line 3),

* *Then* no matter what the boolean value of the second operand is, the expression will evaluate to `True`

Therefore, Python skips the evaluation of the second operand all together.

[big]#*Use Cases*#

*Example 1*

Let's say at CSM Amusement Park, a ticket is discounted by 15% for people with ages under 7 or over 60. As the IT manager, you implement the following piece of code:

[source,python]
----
1    age = int(input('What is your age? '))
2    if age < 7 or age > 60:
3        # Discount ticket price
----

If the user inputs `6` as their age, at line 2, Python will evaluate `age < 7` and see that it is `True`. Since the user already qualifies to get a discount, there is no reason for Python to check if the user's age is over 60 (`age > 60`) once more.

*Example 2*

In order to graduate from CSM University, you need to have taken at least 120 credits of courses and have written a thesis paper. The program that checks if a student is eligible to graduate has the following piece of code:

[source,python]
----
1    std_id = # get student ID
2    if course_crd(std_id) >= 120 and has_written_thesis(std_id):
3        # Allow student to apply for graduation
----

[NOTE]
[small]#Suppose `course_crd(std_id)` returns the course credits of the student with corresponding `std_id`, and `has_written_thesis(std_id)` returns `True` if that student has written a thesis paper and `False` if not.#

Suppose the student applying for graduation has taken 80 credits of courses. Then, the student is already ineligible for graduation, so there is no need for Python to check once more whether the student has written a thesis paper or not.

#*Additional Remarks*#
----
In order for the input to be a valid floating point number, the string must consist of all numbers except one decimal point. To check that, we can split the string by the decimal point and see if the first and second element of the list are numbers.

len(nums) == 2 at line 11 is an example of utilizing short-circuiting. After the string is split by its decimal point, if the length is not 2, it means the user input is not a valid floating point number. Then there is no reason to check if nums[0] and nums[1] are numeric and can move onto the else block without evaluating the rest.

Suppose you built a program that performs different functions depending on the user commands. Take user input of two integers and a command word. How you take in the input is up to you. The following are the command words and the function your program will perform:

    Command | Function
    --------|------------------------------------------------------------
      Add   | Print the sum of the two numbers
      Sub   | Print the difference of the two numbers (in order of input)
      Mult  | Print the product of the two numbers
      Div   | Print the quotient of the two numbers (in order of input)

Your program should be case-insensitive. In other words, AdD, add, aDD should all trigger the Add command. Suppose for Div, the second number will never be zero. If the command is invalid or the first two inputs are not integers, print an error message.

    Ex1)  Input: 0, 1, Add
           Output: 1
    Ex2)  Input: 3

== Chapter 5 - _for_ and _while_ Loops

In computer programming, the basic building blocks of any program are variables, conditional statements, and iterations. We have learned the first two, and now, let's take a look at iterations in programming.

=== _for_ Loops

The first example of iterations in programming is _for_ loops. The structure is as follows:

.*Structure of a _for_ Loop*
[source,python]
----
1    for var in range(start*, stop, step*):
2       <action>
----

[NOTE]
`*` next to a variable indicates that it is optional.

_start_, _stop_, and _step_ are parameters for the `range` function that take in integer values.

* _start_ - starting integer of the range of numbers (optional)
* _stop_ - stopping integer of the range of numbers that is excluded (necessary)
* _step_ - increment integer value between two consecutive numbers in the range
** Cannot be set to zero (Python will raise an exception if done so)

If _start_ and _step_ are not specified, _start_ is defaulted to `0`, and _step_ is defaulted to `1`. Also, only integer values must be passed to all three parameters.

`var` will iterate, or loop, over the numbers generated by the `range` function. To understand this better, let's look at some examples.

.*_for_ Loop Example*
[source,python]
----
 1    print('for i in range(3):')
 2    for i in range(3):  # stop = 3
 3        print(i, end=' ')
 4
 5    print('\nfor j in range(3, 5):')
 6    for j in range(3, 5):  # start, stop = 3, 5
 7        print(j, end=' ')
 8
 9    print('\nfor k in range(0, 8, 2):')
10    for k in range(0, 8, 2):  # start, stop, step = 0, 8, 2
11        print(k, end=' ')
----

.*Output*
----
for i in range(3):
0 1 2
for j in range(3, 5):
3 4
for k in range(0, 8, 2):
0 2 4 6
----

*Explanation*

For lines 2-3, the variable `i` is iterating over a range of numbers from `0` to `2` - because `3` is exclusive. Therefore, in the output, ``0 1 2 `` is printed.

If we go in more depth, `range(3)` returns a _list-like_ object, which looks like `[0, 1, 2]`. The difference between a list and a `range` object is that the elements of a list is created first before use, and the numbers of a `range` object is created on the fly. This means that for a list with numbers from `0` to `999`, all 1000 numbers are created and allocated a space in the computer's memory, but for `range(1000)`, each number is created one by one at the start of each iteration.

[NOTE]
The `list()` function can be used to transform a `range` object to a list. For example, `list(range(3))` will give the list `[0, 1, 2]`.

Regardless, ultimately, `for i in range(3)` means that `i` will be iterating over the sequence `[0, 1, 2]`.

[%header,cols="^.^10%,^.^21%,^.^23%,^.^23%,^.^23%"]
|====
2+|  | Loop 1 | Loop 2 | Loop 3
| [fira-code]#*var*# | [fira-code]#i# | `i = 0` | `i = 1` | `i = 2`
| [fira-code]#*<action>*# | [fira-code]#print(i, end=' ')# | `print(0, end=' ')` | `print(1, end=' ')` | `print(2, end=' ')`
2+| [big fira-code]#*Output at end of each loop*# | `'0 '` | `'0 1 '` | `'0 1 2 '`
|====

At the start of loop `n`, the value of the ``n``^th^ element of the sequence is assigned to `i`. This means that the sequence is iterated through in the order of its elements. Therefore, the two sequences `[0, 1, 2]` and `[2, 0, 1]` will cause different behaviors when `i` iterates over them.

[TIP]
`for var in range(stop)` can also be used to loop through certain actions `stop` number of times. For example, `for i in range(3)` will cause the _for_ loop to loop 3 times.

For lines 6-7, `for j in range(3, 5)` indicates that `j` will be iterating over the sequence `[3, 4]`, where `5` is excluded. Therefore, ``3 4 `` is printed.

For lines 10-11, all _start_, _stop_, and _step_ are specified in `range(0, 8, 2)`. If we unravel this, the `range` function will return a sequence that starts from `0` and ends before `8` in steps of `2`. Therefore, the sequence would look like this `[0, 2, 4, 6]`. So ``0 2 4 6 `` is printed.

====
If you are familiar with arithmetic sequences, you can think of the `range` function as one that returns an arithmetic sequence where,

* _n_ = `ceil((end - start) / step)`
* _a~0~_ = `start`
* _a~n~_ = `end`
* _d_ = `step`
====

*Things to Note*

. _start_ and _step_ are optional parameters. If not provided, _start_ will be `0`, and _step_ will be `1`.
.. If one number is provided, it is assigned to _stop_. For example, in `range(3)`, _start_ is 0, _stop_ is 3, and _step_ is 1.
.. If two numbers are provided, they are assigned to _start_ and _stop_, in that order. For example, in `range(3, 5)`, _start_ is 3, _stop_ is 5, and _step_ is 1.
.. If all three numbers are provided, they are assigned to each parameter in given order. For example, in `range(1, 9, 2)`, _start_ is 1, _stop_ is 9, and _step_ is 2.
. If _step_ is negative, then you can iterate through a range of numbers in a _reverse_ order.
+
[source,python]
----
for i in range(3, 0, -1):
    print(i, end=' ')
# this will output '3 2 1 '
----
+
. If _start_ is greater than or equal to _stop_ (or less than if _step_ is negative), then the `range` function will return an empty sequence. Therefore, there will be nothing to iterate through, and essentially, that _for_ loop would be doing nothing.
.. For example, both `range(3, 1)` and `range(-3, -1, -1)` would return an empty sequence
. `<action>` inside the _for_ loop must be indented one level farther rightward than the _for_ loop statement.
.. For example, in the following _for_ loop:
+
[source,python]
----
for var in range(stop):
    <action1>
    <action2>
    <action3>
<action4>
----
+
Actions 1-3 are iterated over `stop` number of times. After the _for_ loop is exited, `<action4>` is executed _once_.
. You can have a _for_ loop inside a _for_ loop (called a nested _for_ loop), generally used to traverse two-dimensional lists (which is not important as of now).

For Exercise 5.1 Q3, the student can use a nested for loop:

    for i in range(4):
        for j in range(i + 1):
            print('*', end='')
        print('')

but the preferred answer is faster.

For Exercise 5.2:

Q1 is a standard way to calculate the sum of all numbers in a list. range(5) can be replaced with any list with numbers.

==== _for_ Loop with _break_ and _else_

As you code more and more programs, there will come a time when you will want to end a loop early when a certain condition is met. For example, let's say you are searching for a student with a certain name. You have a list containing names of all the students of a school. If you write a program that allows the user to search for a student with a certain name, it may look like this:

.*Example Program*
[source,python]
----
1    students = [...]  # filled with names as strings
2    name_to_search = input('Name of student to search: ')
3    for name in students:
4        if name == name_to_search:
5            print('Student found. Name:', name)
6            ...
----

Now, let's assume the name you are searching for is `'John'`, and the list `students` looks like `['John', 'Anna', 'Simon', 'Justin', 'Rachel', 'Kevin']`. Then, the program will find the student in one iteration, which means the last 5 iterations are meaningless. We want the _for_ loop to stop iterating once we find the student we want. In order to do this, we can use the `break` keyword.

.*Example Program (Altered)*
[source,python]
----
1    students = [...]  # filled with names as strings
2    name_to_search = input('Name of student to search: ')
3    for name in students:
4        if name == name_to_search:
5            print('Student found. Name:', name)
6            break
----

What `break` does is that once the interpreter reads the keyword, it will break out of the current loop. So once the interpreter reaches line 6, it will break out of the _for_ loop (at line 3). This enhances efficiency and reduces meaningless iterations. If `break` is used inside nested _for_ loops, the interpreter will break out of the innermost _for_ loop that the keyword `break` is contained in.

[source,python]
----
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):  # break
        if j == 1:
            break

for i in range(3):  # break
    for j in range(3):
        print(j)
    if i == 1:

4        break

# Part (b)
3    if el % 2 == 0:
4        break

# Part (c)
2    for el in lst:
3        if el < 0:
4            break
5        print(el)
----

You can also pair a _for_ loop with an _else_ statement to check if your loop has finished normally without breaking prematurely.

.*Example Usage 1*
[source,python]
----
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print('did not break out of for loop')
----

.*Output*

----

    print(i)
    if i == 1:
        break

----

.*Output*

As these examples show, the _else_ block is evaluated only if the _for_ loop completed without breaking. This can be useful when checking *_if all_* and *_if any_* conditions. _if all_ conditions check if all elements of a sequence satisfy a certain condition. Likewise, _if any_ conditions check if at least one element of a sequence satisfies a certain condition.

Let's say you want to check if a list contains only even numbers. You want to print `True` if it does, and `False` if it does not. You can rephrase this into two equivalent statements:

. Print `True` _if all_ elements of a list are even, and `False` if not.
. Print `False` _if any_ element of a list is odd, and `True` if not.

Or if combined:

[start=3]
. Print `True` _if all_ elements of a list are even, and `False` _if any_ element of a list is odd.

When programming, we usually follow the logic of the second statement.

[source,python]
----
1    lst = [...]
2    for el in lst:
3        if el % 2 == 1:  # if any element is odd, print False
4            print(False)
5            break
6    else:  # if not, print True
7        print(True)
----

You can fill in the values for `lst` at line 1 and check the resulting output. In summary, the `else` block in conjunction with _for_ loops will allow you to check if the loop was terminated without breaking. However, later on, when dealing with _if all_ and _if any_ conditions, you may want to write a function/method instead (to be covered later).

==== _for_ Loop with Iterables

Let's say we have a list with all the names of the students in a school, and we want to find a student named Peter. To do this, we need to check each item in the list one by one until we find the student with the name Peter. The act of going over each element of a list is called _traversing_ or _iterating_ through the list, and we can do this with _for_ loops.

`range(n)` can be used to iterate through a set pattern of numbers or to loop through `n` times, but we can use other iterables in place of `range()` to traverse through each element of that iterable.

Let's look at lists first:

.*_for_ Loop with Lists*
[source,python]
----
1    a = ['Hello', 'World', '!!']
2    for s in a:
3        print(s, end=' ')
----

.*Output*
----
Hello World !!
----

Let's try to imitate the behavior of the `count()` method with _for_ loops.

.*`count()` Execution*
[source,python]
----
1    def my_count(lst, x):
2        count = 0
3        for el in lst:
4            if el == x:
5                count += 1
6        return count
----

At line 3, we traverse over `lst` by assigning each element of `lst` to `el` one by one. At lines 4-5, if `el` is equal in value to the `x` we are trying to count, we increment the `count` variable by 1. After all elements are iterated through, we return the value of the `count` variable at line 6. As such, we can use _for_ loops to traverse through and operate on lists.

One common use of _for_ loops with lists is to find the maximum or minimum element of that list. Here is the example to find the maximum element of a list:

.*Finding the maximum element*
[source,python]
----
1    def my_max(lst):
2        max_el = lst[0]
3        for el in lst:
4            if el > max_el:
5                max_el = el
6        return max_el
----

At line 2, `max_el` is set to the first element of `lst`. While iterating through the list, line 4 checks if each element `el` is greater than the current `max_el`. If it is, then `max_el` is updated. At the end of each loop, `max_el` will be the maximum of all the elements currently covered. When the _for_ loop is finished, it would have iterated through all the elements. Hence, `max_el` will be the maximum element of the whole list.

Tuples and strings can be iterated through in a similar manner as lists. Doing so for tuples will iterate through each element whereas doing so for strings will iterate through each character. However, in order to iterate through a dictionary, you need to do things differently.

Remember that dictionaries have a _key-value_ pairing, so there are two values to iterate through. There are many ways to iterate through a dictionary, and we will cover two of them.

Here is the general format of the first method:

.*Traversing Dictionaries: Method 1*
[source,python]
----
1    dct = {...}  # filled with arbitrary values
2    for key in dct:
3        # use dict[key] to access value
----

In this format, we are iterating through all the _keys_ of a dictionary. To access the _value_, we need to retrieve it by using the _key_ as the index. Here is an example of its use:

.*Method 1 Example*
[source,python]
----
1    idt_pw_map = {
2        'user1' : 'abc123',
3        'user2' : 'def456',
4        'user3' : 'ghi789'
5    }
6    for idt in idt_pw_map:
7        print('ID: {}    PW: {}'.format(idt, idt_pw_map[idt]))
----

.*Output*
----
ID: user1    PW: abc123
ID: user2    PW: def456
ID: user3    PW: ghi789
----

However, this method does not explicitly show that we are looping through a dictionary because it shares the same format as other iterables. The following format is a more preferred method in Python:

.*Traversing Dictionaries: Method 2*
[source,python]
----
1    dct = {...}  # filled with arbitrary values
2    for key, value in dct.items():
3        # ...action
----

In this example, we use `items()`, a [fira-code]#dict# method. By using the `items()` method, we can iterate through both the `key` and `value` entries, explicitly showing that we are iterating through a dictionary. Here is an example of its use:

.*Method 2 Example*
[source,python]
----
1    idt_pw_map = {
2        'user1' : 'abc123',
3        'user2' : 'def456',
4        'user3' : 'ghi789'
5    }
6    for idt, pw in idt_pw_map.items():
7        print('ID: {}    PW: {}'.format(idt, pw))
----

.*Output*
----
ID: user1    PW: abc123
ID: user2    PW: def456
ID: user3    PW: ghi789
----

.#*Exercise 5.5: Write your own program*#
----
Q1. Write a program to find the minimum element of a given list.

Q2. Write a program to imitate the behavior of the in operator. In other words, make a function that checks if specified element is in the given iterable.

Q3. Challenge: Write a program to count the frequency of each character that appears in a string and return the result as a dictionary. For example, for the string 'banana', the return value would be (not in particular order):

        {'b': 1, 'a': 3, 'n': 2}

Hint: Iterate through the string and create new entries if a character is not in the dictionary yet. You can refer back to Chapter 3 for dictionary methods.

Q4. Challenge: Write a program to convert a dictionary to a list. Each KV pair is to be converted to a tuple. For example,

        {'b': 1, 'a': 3, 'n': 2} -> [('b', 1), ('a', 3), ('n', 2)]

==== *Challenge:* List Comprehension

Up until now, you learned a few ways to create lists. These are couple possible ways to define a list containing numbers from 1 through 10:

[source,python]
----
# Method 1
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# Method 2
a = []
for i in range(1, 11):
    a.append(i)
----

What if you wanted a list to contain numbers from 1 through 100? Method 1 will be too cumbersome, and method 2 needs three lines just to initialize one list. Can we do better? We can by using list comprehension, which is a more elegant way of defining lists by using the _for_ keyword.

*Basic Structure*

A list comprehension uses the following format:

[source,python]
----
[expression for element in iterable]
----

For example, if you wanted to create a list containing numbers from 1 to 100 with list comprehension, it would look like this:

[source,python]
----
a = [i for i in range(1, 101)]

# Compare to using for loop
a = []
for i in range(1, 101):
    a.append(i)
----

You can modify the `expression` portion to get more specific results. For example, if you wanted a list that contains all the square numbers from 1 to 10, it would look like this:

[source,python]
----
a = [i * i for i in range(1, 11)]
# or
a = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11)]

# Compare to using for loop
a = []
for i in range(1, 11):
    a.append(i * i)
----

.#*Exercise 5.6: List Comprehension Basics*#
----
Q1. Create a list containing each character of the string 'HelloWorld'.
Q2. Create a list containing [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 1.0].
Q3. Create a list containing 5 zeroes (i.e. [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]).
----

#*Answer*#
[source,python]
----
1    # Q1
2    a = [c for c in 'HelloWorld']
3    # Q2
4    b = [i / 10 for i in range(1, 11)]
5    # Q3
6    c = [0 for i in range(5)]
----

*List Comprehension with Conditionals*

You can also use conditionals with list comprehension to add more selectivity. It follows this format:

[source,python]
----
[expression for element in iterable if condition]
----

For example, if you wanted to create a list that contains all even numbers up to 10, it would look like this:

[source,python]
----
a = [i for i in range(11) if i % 2 == 0]

# Compare to using for loop
a = []
for i in range(11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        a.append(i)
----

.#*Exercise 5.7: List Comprehension with Conditionals*#
----
Q1. a) Create a list containing every odd numbers up to 10 with conditionals.
    b) Do part (a) without using conditionals.

Q2. Create a list containing all uppercased words of the list ['abc', 'CAT', 'DOG', 'apple', 'HelLO'].

The resulting list should be ['CAT', 'DOG'].

For more practice, try writing each of them with for loops and compare it with list comprehension. Try to see which part of the for loop corresponds to which of list comprehension.
----

#*Answer*#
[source,python]
----
1    # Q1 (a)
2    a = [i for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 1]
3    # Q1 (b)
4    a = [i for i in range(1, 10, 2)]
5    a = [i * 2 + 1 for i in range(10 // 2)]
6
7    # Q2
8    lst = ['abc', 'CAT', 'DOG', 'apple', 'HelLO']
9    b = [word for word in lst if word.upper() == word]
----

==== _for_ Loop Practice Problems

.*Question 1*
----
Count the number of even numbers in a list and print the number. You may create a list and fill it with arbitrary values.
----

.*Answer*
[source,python]
----
1    count, lst = 0, [...]  # arbitrary values
2    for n in lst:
3        if n % 2 == 0:
4            count += 1
5    print(count)
----

.*Question 2*
----
Get two lines of user input of multiple values separated by a single comma. Convert each line into one list. For example,

    Input: a,b,c,d
           1,2,3,4
    -> Two lists: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
                  ['1', '2', '3', '4']

Using the two lists, create a new dictionary with the elements of the first list as keys and the elements of the second list as values. Assume that there are no duplicate elements in the first list. Print the dictionary. If the lengths of the lists are different, set the length of the smaller list as the length of the dictionary. For example,

    Ex1) Input : a,b,c,d
                 1,2,3,4
         Output: {'a': '1', 'b': '2', 'c': '3', 'd': '4'}
    Ex2) Input : a,b,c
                 1,2,3,4,5
         Output: {'a': '1', 'b': '2', 'c': '3'}

You may use the built-in min() function to find out the length of the smaller list.

    min(3, 2) -> 2
    min('a', 'b') -> 'a'
----

.*Answer*
[source,python]
----
1    lst1 = input().split(',')
2    lst2 = input().split(',')
3    n = min(len(lst1), len(lst2))
4    d = {}
5
6    for i in range(n):
7        d[lst1[i]] = lst2[i]
8    print(d)
----

.*Question 3*
----
Get a user input of a postive integer. Check if the number has more than four factors. Print 'more than 4 factors' if it does, and print the number of factors if it does not.

        Ex1) Input : 16
             Output: more than 4 factors
             Explanation: 16 has 5 factors (1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
        Ex2) Input : 9
             Output: 3 factors
             Explanation: 9 has 3 factors (1, 3, 9)

Hint: Start approaching this problem as a prime number problem (Exercise 5.4).
----

.*Answer*
[source,python]
----
1    n, factors = int(input()), 2  # because 1 and n are factors
2    for i in range(2, n):
3        if n % i == 0:
4            factors += 1
5        if factors > 4:
6            print('more than 4 factors')
7            break
8    else:
9        print(factors, 'factors')
----

=== _while_ Loops

Whereas in _for_ loops, you had a variable that iterated over elements of a sequence, _while_ loops will continue to loop as long as a certain condition is fulfilled.

.*Structure of a _while_ loop*
[source,python]
----
1    while <condition>:
2        <action>
----

A `<condition>` should be a variable, expression, or something else that evaluates to a boolean value. As long as `<condition>` evaluates to `True`, the action inside the loop would be executed.

Step-by-step execution of a _while_ loop is as follows:

. `<condition>` is evaluated.
. If the boolean value is
.. `True`, execute the action and loop back to step 1
.. `False`, exit _while_ loop

.*_while_ Loop Example 1*
[source,python]
----
1    x = 0
2    while x < 3:
3        print(x)
4        x += 1
----

.*Output*
----
0
1
2
----

This _while_ loop is printing numbers that is less than 3 (starting from 0). How is this _while_ loop being executed?

[%header,cols=6,cols="^.^12%,^.^12%,^.^19%,^.^19%,^.^19%,^.^19%"]
|====
2+| | Loop 1 | Loop 2 | Loop 3 | Loop 4
h| Variable | `x` | [fira-code]#0# | [fira-code]#1# | [fira-code]#2# | [fira-code]#3#
h| Condition | `x < 3` | [fira-code]#True# | [fira-code]#True# | [fira-code]#True# | [fira-code]#False#
.2+h| Action | `print(x)` | Prints `0` | Prints `1` | Prints `2` |
| `x += 1` | [fira-code]#x = 1# | [fira-code]#x = 2# | [fira-code]#x = 3# |
|====

From this table, we can see that even though the `<action>` (lines 3-4) is executed 3 times, the `<condition>` is checked 4 times. Before the _while_ loop is exited, the condition has to evaluate to `False` first. Hence, the `<condition>` is checked one more time than the number of executions of `<action>`.

.*_while_ Loop Example 2*
[source,python]
----
1    num = int(input('Input a number less than 10: '))
2    while num >= 10:
3        num = int(input('Input a number less than 10: '))
4    # ... more actions
----

What is this example doing? Let's break it down step-by-step. First step was to evaluate the `<condition>`, which is `num >= 10`. If `num` is greater than or equal to `10`, line 3 would be executed. On the contrary, if `num` is less than `10`, the interpreter will exit the _while_ loop and continue on to line 4.

====
The _while_ loop would be executed as long as the variable `num` is holding a value that is greater than or equal to `10`.
====

We figured out what the condition is. Next, what is the `<action>` doing? On line 3, the program is asking for a user input. If we read the prompt message, we can see that the program wants the user to input a number that is less than 10. This user input is then stored inside the variable `num`. If we combine `<condition>` and `<action>`, we get:

====
The _while_ loop would be executed as long as the user inputs a value that is greater than or equal to `10`.
====

The above is one way to do an _input check_. This is when we try to account for user mistakes. If we look at the previous example, we can tell that the variable `num` is supposed to hold a number value that is less than 10. But what if the user inputs `11`? `num` would be holding an invalid numerical value. To _catch_ such user mistakes, we can use a _while_ loop to keep asking the user for a valid number.

4        i += 1
5    print(sum, sum / 10)
----

6    while num > 0:

8        num -= 1
9    print(mystery_num)
----

.#*Answer*#
----
mystery_num is the factorial of num.
----

==== Infinite Loops

Infinite loops are loops that are repeated endlessly, either intentionally or accidentally.

.*Infinite _while_ Loop*
[source,python]
----
1    x = 1
2    while x >= 0:
3        x += 1
----

The _while_ loop will keep executing as long as `x` is a positive number. In line 1, the value 1 is stored in `x`, and line 3 keeps incrementing ``x``'s value by 1. Therefore, `x` will always be positive, causing the loop to repeat continuously. To prevent these kinds of accidents, it is important to use the correct condition.

However, there are intentional uses of infinite loops.

.*Infinite _while_ Loop*
[source,python]
----
1    print('Input a command')
2    while True:
3        cmd = input()
4        if cmd == 'quit':
5            break
6        # execute command
7    ...
----

The above infinite _while_ loop can be used to continue taking user input until the user wants to 'quit' the program. The loop continues endlessly because the condition is set to `True`. In this case, the loop will continue until the user inputs the word `'quit'`. Then the condition at line 4 will evaluate to `True`, and the interpreter will break out of the _while_ loop and continue on to line 7.

The previous example can also be written with a non-infinite _while_ loop.

.*Infinite _while_ Loop Equivalent*
[source,python]
----
1    print('Input a command')
2    cmd = input()
3    while cmd != 'quit':
4        # execute command
5        cmd = input()
6    ...
----

While they both accomplish the same thing, the thought process behind the two programs are different. The infinite _while_ loop example is a _repeat-until_ loop whereas the second example is a _repeat-until_ loop (or just a _while_ loop).

The infinite loop is called a _repeat-until_ loop because we *repeat* lines 3-6 *until* the user inputs `'quit'`. If you want to repeat certain actions until a condition is met, you can use the infinte _while_ loop pattern and break once that condition is met.

If you want to convert a _repeat-until_ loop to a non-infinite _while_ loop, you can invert the condition. If we compare the condition in line 4 of the first example (`cmd == 'quit'`) and the condition in line 3 of the second example (`cmd != 'quit'`), we can see that they are inverted versions of each other.

Get a user input of two positive integers, x and y. How you choose to receive the inputs is up to you. Print out the value of x ** y (x raised to the power of y). Evaluate the value using a while loop. You cannot use the ** operator or the math module to evaluate the output. Assume that the inputs are always valid.

.*Question 3*

A list has a reverse() method that reverses the list. In this problem, reverse a list using only a while loop and no reverse() method, then print out the reversed list. Receive the original list as user input. Each element will be separated by a single comma. You may reverse the original list directly or create a new reversed list.

    Ex) Input : 1,2,3,abc,hello
        Output: ['hello', 'abc', '3', '2', '1']

4        lst[i], lst[n - i - 1] = lst[n - i - 1], lst[i]
5        i += 1
6    print(lst)

# Option 2: Create a new list (for loop is better)
1    lst = input().split(',')
2    n, new_lst = len(lst), ['' for i in range(len(lst))]
3    for i in range(n):
4        new_lst[i] = lst[n - i - 1]
5    print(new_lst)
----

=== The _continue_ Keyword

While going over infinite loops in the previous section, we covered the `break` keyword. It was used to prematurely exit a _while_ or _for_ loop once a certain condition was met. Similarly, the `continue` keyword can be used to prematurely end a single iteration if a certain condition is met.

[source,python]
----
 1    print('break example')
 2    for i in range(1, 6):
 3        if i % 2 == 0:
 4            break
 5        print(i)
 6
 7    print('continue example')
 8    for i in range(1, 6):
 9        if i % 2 == 0:
10            continue
11        print(i)
----

.*Output*
----

----

This example shows the difference of `break` and `continue`. Using `break` will cause the whole loop to be terminated, whereas `continue` causes the current iteration to be completed. Once the program reaches line 4, the _for_ loop is exited. However, once the program reaches line 10, line 11 is skipped and `i` moves on to the next number in sequence.

The `continue` keyword can be used to skip over unnecessary parts when a certain condition is met. While not used too often, it can be helpful in reducing lines of code.

=== Difference Between _for_ and _while_

Both loops are similar in the sense that they, well, loop. They repeat certain actions for a number of times. So why is there two loops, and when should we use which?

.*Print 0 to 3: _for_ Loop*
[source,python]
----
1    for i in range(4):
2        print(i)
----

.*Print 0 to 3: _while_ Loop*
[source,python]
----
1    i = 0  # assign variable
2    while i < 4:
3        print(i)
4        i += 1  # increment variable
----

Immediately, we can tell that the _while_ loop uses two more lines: one to assign a value to the variable to be used in condition-checking and another to alter the value of that variable. Since the variable created in a _for_ loop iterates over a set sequence of numbers, there is no need to manually change the value yourself.

But what about the following example that we have covered earlier?

[source,python]
----
1    num = int(input('Input a number less than 10: '))
2    while num >= 10:
3        num = int(input('Input a number less than 10: '))
----

It is hard to come up with an equivalent for the _for_ loop because there isn't a set sequence a variable can iterate through. As such, if you need to repeat certain actions as long as a non-sequential condition is met, you should use a _while_ loop.

== Chapter 6 - Functions

To start, what is a function? The first thing you might think of is a mathematical function, and that is correct! A function, whether in mathematics or computer programming, is a mechanism that takes in an input and transforms it somehow to an output.

The following is an example of a mathematical function.

image::ch3_function_ex1.jpg[align="center",width="60%"]

The above function, `f(x)`, will add 3 to the input. Here, 2 is the _input_ of `f(x)`, and 5 is the _output_ of `f(x)`.

We can see that the purpose of `f(x)` is to increment its inputs by 3. Likewise, in computer programming, each function serves a specific purpose, or a _function_.

=== Function Structure

First, functions in Python have the following format.

.*Structure of a Python Function*
[source,python]
----
1    def <function_name>(<parameters>*):
2        <code_block>
3        return <output>*
----

There are 3 important things to note when defining a Python function. These are required and you must follow these at all times.

. Every Python function should start with the Python keyword `def`
. The name of the function should be followed with parentheses (`()`) and a colon (`:`)
. The code block inside the function must be indented accordingly (4 spaces in most cases)

The following are some standard coding conventions for Python:

. `<function_name>`, like variable names, should all be lowercase with separate words linked together with a single underscore (`_`)
. If the function takes in multiple inputs, or _parameters_, they should be separated with one comma and whitespace (e.g. `f(param1, param2, ...)`)
. Keyword `def` and `<function_name>` should be separated with one whitespace
. There should be no whitespace in between `<function_name>`, `(<parameters>*)`, and the colon

*Additional Explanation:*

. In computer programming, inputs are called *_parameters_* or *_arguments_*, and outputs are called *_return values_*
. Anything inside the angle brackets (`<>`) are to be filled by you
. The `*` symbol next to `<parameters>` indicates that you may have 0 or more parameters
. Similarly, the `*` symbol next to `<output>` indicates that the return statement is optional. In other words, you do not need to include the line `return <output>` (line 3) in your Python function (i.e. it is optional)
. `return` is a keyword reserved by Python, and it is used to _return_ the `<output>`.
.. The Python interpreter will exit the function when it encounters the `return` keyword, so if `return` is placed before the end of the function, the function will be exited prematurely.
.. If no `<output>` is specified after `return` or there is no `return` keyword inside the function, the function will not return a value. One such example is the `print()` function.

Now that we have learned the structure of Python functions, let's look at some examples.

.*Example Functions*
[source,python]
----
 1    def is_even(num):
 2        return num % 2 == 0
 3
 4    def is_same_str(str1, str2):
 5        return str1 == str2
 6
 7    def area_square(length):
 8        area = length * length
 9        return area
10
11    def message(name):
12        print('Hi! My name is', str(name))
----

Now we have four functions, but how do we use them?

=== Function Calls

To use, or _call_, functions, we use the following form:

[source,python]
----
<func_name>(<param>*)
----

We use the function name like a variable and follow it with parentheses, containing any necessary parameters. This is called a _function call_. Up until now, we have actually seen a lot of function calls. For example, `print()` is a function that takes any value as a parameter.

[source,python]
----
print('Hello World')
----

This would be a call to the `print()` function, where `print` corresponds to `<func_name>`, and `'Hello World'` corresponds to `<param>*`. In such case, we say that the string `'Hello World'` was passed as a(n) parameter/argument_ to the `print()` function.

Let's try calling the example functions defined earlier.

.*Example Functions (Cont.)*
[source,python]
----
 1    def is_even(num):
 2        return num % 2 == 0
 3
 4    def is_same_str(str1, str2):
 5        return str1 == str2
 6
 7    def area_square(length):
 8        area = length * length
 9        return area
10
11    def message(name):
12        print('Hi! My name is', str(name))
13
14    even4 = is_even(4)
15    even5 = is_even(5)
16    print('4 is even:', even4)
17    print('5 is even:', even5)
18
19    check_str = is_same_str('hello', 'Hello')
20    print('\'hello\' == \'Hello\':', check_str)
21
22    length = 10
23    print('Area of square:', area_square(length))
24
25    message('Python Master')
----

.*Output*
----
4 is even: True
5 is even: False
'hello' == 'Hello': False
Area of square: 100
Hi! My name is Python Master
----

*Additional Explanation*

.*Purpose of each functions*
[horizontal]
`is_even(num)`::
Returns `True` if `num` is an even number and `False` otherwise

`is_same_str(str1, str2)`::
Returns `True` if `str1` and `str2` are the same strings and `False` otherwise

`area_square(length)`::
Calculates the area of a square with a side length of `length`

`message(name)`::
Prints a message with provided `name`

Lines 14, 15, and 19 show that return values of functions can be assigned to a variable.

Lines 14 and 15 show that raw values can be passed as function arguments, while line 23 show that variables can also be passed as function arguments.

Unlike `is_even(num)`, `is_same_str(str1, str2)`, and `area_square(length)` functions, `message(name)` does not need a `print()` statement, firstly, because it is not returning any value, and secondly, because it already has a `print()` statement inside its function.

.#*Exercise 6.1: Make your own functions*#
----
Q1. Make a function named foo. It will take one number as a parameter and return a value twice the input. For example,

def foo(num):
    ...

Q2. Function name: compare
    Parameter    : Two numbers
    Return value : The greater number
                   If equal, either is fine

Q3. You are working at a zoo. The ticket price is $3 for children and $5 for adults. Make a Python function to calculate the total ticket price given the number of children and adults visiting. Names for the function, parameters, and any other necessary variables are up to you.

Call your functions with arbitrary values as parameters. Use the return value to print out meaningful information. The message to print out is entirely up to you but try to briefly explain the relationship between the function arguments and the return value.

For example, if you were describing the built-in sum() function, you can do print('The sum of the numbers in the list is', sum(lst)).

=== Placement of Functions

In previous examples, functions were placed in the beginning of the code. This is a normal thing to do. Programmers will usually cluster necessary functions in the beginning of the program and access it whenever and wherever necessary.

Remember that if we want to use a variable, you have to create one first and assign a value to it. It is the same with functions. To use a function, we must define it first. Once defined, it can be accessed from anywhere in the code. This also means that a function must be placed before the line where it is used because Python looks at your program from top to bottom.

.*Invalid Function Placement*
[source,python]
----
1    foo()
2
3    def foo():
4        ...
----

.*Sample Output*
----
...
NameError: name 'foo' is not defined
----

Running any Python program in such structure will cause the interpreter to raise an exception.

.*Valid Function Placement*
[source,python]
----
...
  i    def bar():
i+1        print('Hello World')
...
  j    bar()
...
  k    bar()
----

This placement is valid for any line numbers `i`, `j`, `k`, such that `i` (`i + 1` to be exact) is less than `j` and `k`. The interpreter will start reading your program from line 1 downwards, and when it reaches line `i`, it will create a function with the name `bar`. Only then can you call the `bar` function.

For the sake of comparison, you can define the function `bar` on line 1 and access it all the way from line 500.

[discrete]
==== Extra Stuff

Remember the exception Python raises if the function is not defined before use?

----
NameError: name 'foo' is not defined
----

Let's compare this to the error message shown (on Python shell) when variables are not defined before use.

----
>>> a + 3
...
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
----

We can see that the error message is pretty much identical. Why is that?

It is because function names are also variables. They are variables that are holding a `_function_` object. We will cover objects in more detail later, but let's look at the following interaction in Python shell:

----
>>> a = 3
>>> type(a)
<class 'int'>
>>> b = 'hello'
>>> type(b)
<class 'str'>
>>> def c():
...     print('')
...
>>> type(c)
<class 'function'>
----

[NOTE]
The ellipsis (`...`) indicates that you haven't finished your code yet. After finishing your function on shell, you can press kbd:[enter] to continue.

We can see that `c` has a type, just like any other variables. A value of type `function` is assigned to the variable `c`.

Why is this significant? Since function names are no different to regular variables, maybe we can use function names as we use variables. For example, maybe we can pass a function as an argument for another function? Try it out!

=== Why Use Functions?

Having the ability to define my own function is nice and all, but why do we need functions? There are a few reasons.

. It reduces duplication of code.
+
For example, let's say you need to calculate the total ticket price, like in the previous exercise. If you did not use functions, you would need to calculate it each time:
+
[source, python]
----
1    num_child, num_adult = 3, 5
2    total = 3 * num_child + 5 * num_adult
3
4    num_child, num_adult = 7, 4
5    total = 3 * num_child + 5 * num_adult
...
----
+
But if you defined a `calc_total()` function, you can do this:
+
[source, python]
----
1    total = calc_total(3, 5)
2
3    total = calc_total(7, 4)
...
----
+
. It increases readability and organizes your code into logical steps.
. If you need to make a change, you only need to change the function instead of your whole program.
+
Let's refer back to the ticket example. Let's say you wrote the following code:
+
[source, python]
----
1    num_child, num_adult = 3, 5
2    total = 3 * num_child + 5 * num_adult
3
4    num_child, num_adult = 7, 4
5    total = 3 * num_child + 5 * num_adult
...
----
+
But the pricing changed, and now it is $4 for children and $6 for adults. Then, you would need to go change `3` to `4` and `5` to `6` in lines 2, 5, and so on.
+
But if you have defined a function, you only need to change the values in the function.
+
. You can use functions in other programs as well, like how we use the `print()` function in our program even though we did not define it.

=== Functions and Mutability

If you recall, some data types, such as lists or dictionaries, are mutable, which means changes made to those values would directly change the object instead of creating a new one. Then what would happen if mutable values that are passed as parameters are changed inside the function?

Let's look at the following examples:

.*Immutable Value*
[source,python]
----
1    def foo(s):
2        s += '123'
3
4    a = 'Hi'
5    print('Before:', a)
6    foo(a)
7    print('After:', a)
----

.*Output*
----
Before: Hi
After: Hi
----

On line 6, the string `a` is passed as the parameter for the function `foo`, and inside the function, the string value is changed, from `'Hi'` to `'Hi123'`. However, after the function is exited, we can see that the value of `a` is not changed. This is because when `'123'` was added to `s` on line 6, a new string was created and stored in `s`. Ultimately, because `a` and `s` were pointing to different objects, the value of `a` did not change.

How about for mutable values?

.*Mutable Value*
[source,python]
----
1    def foo(lst):
2        lst += [10]
3
4    a = [1, 2, 3]
5    print('Before:', a)
6    foo(a)
7    print('After:', a)
----

.*Output*
----
Before: [1, 2, 3]
After: [1, 2, 3, 10]
----

Looking at the output, we can see that the change made to the list inside the function affected the list `a`. When `a` is passed as the parameter on line 6, it causes both `a` and `lst` to point to the same list, `[1, 2, 3]`. Since lists are mutable, when the element `10` was added to `lst`, the change was made directly to the object, and since both `a` and `lst` point to the same list, the change was reflected on `a` as well.

The key point to remember is that if mutable values are passed as function parameters and are changed inside the function, the same change will be reflected outside the function as well.

Do not return anything. Assume that the parameters are always correct, and the integers are valid indices. Here is an example interaction:

    lst2 = bar(lst1, x, y)

== Chapter 7 - Object-Oriented Programming

You may have heard about the term *object-oriented programming* if you have learned other programming languages such as Java or C++. These languages, as well as Python, are object-oriented programming languages. OOP is a programming idea, which tries to create programs by having different objects interact with each other. Objects in programming are basically software implementations of objects in real life.

Let's take a look at the following example. Say you want to create a video game about car racing. Taking real life car racing into consideration, some objects you might implement are cars, other racers (CPUs), and the user. These objects might interact in the following manner:

image::ch7_oop_ex1.jpg[width="80%",align="center"]

Now the question is how do we create/implement objects in Python? This will be explained in the next section.

<<<

=== Class

In Python, we use classes to represent objects. If we look at objects in real life, they each have unique attributes and behaviors. Cars, for example, have attributes, like its color and brand, and behaviors/actions, such as accelerating and braking. As a result, when we create objects, we try to give them appropriate attributes (in forms of variables) and behaviors (in forms of methods).

==== Structure of a Class

Before we look into the structure of a Python class, let's look at an example class first.

.*Example of a Python Class*
[source,python]
----
 1    class Car:
 2
 3        brand = 'BMW'
 4
 5        def __init__(self, color):
 6            self.vel = 0
 7            self.color = color
 8
 9        def accelerate(self, vel):
10            self.vel += vel
11
12        def brake(self, vel):
13            self.vel -= vel
14
15        def info(self):
16            return 'Brand: {}, Color: {}, Speed: {}'.format(Car.brand, self.color, self.vel)
----

All classes in Python must start with the `class` keyword followed by the class name as shown in line 1. In the previous example, the name of the class is _Car_. Each class in Python are made up of three important components: constructors, variables, and methods.

*Constructor*

The next important part of a class is its constructor. A class, different from other variables, can hold multiple information. For example, an `int` type variable can only hold a single integer, and a `string` type variable can only hold a sequence of characters. However, in this example, the `Car` class can hold three different values: its brand, velocity, and color. The job of the constructor is to assign values to these variables and create an instance of the class. And as the example shows, the method `\\__init__` represents constructors in Python.

In this class, the constructor (lines 5-7) assigns values to the variables `vel` and `color`. The reason why it does not assign a value to the variable `brand` will be explained later. Just like functions, the constructor for the `Car` class takes in `self` and `color` as parameters. Here, `self` refers to the _instance_ of the class as parameter, as supposed to the class itself. After the constructor receives the values for each parameter, it assigns them to its variables in lines 6 and 7. This portion will be explained in further detail later.

Let's see how constructors are used.

.*`Car` Class Instantiation*
[source,python]
----
# Create instances of class
car1 = Car('red')
car2 = Car('blue')
# Print information of each instance
print(car1.info())
print(car2.info())
----

.*Output*
----
Brand: BMW, Color: red, Speed: 0
Brand: BMW, Color: blue, Speed: 0
----

As you can see, even though the constructor receives two parameters, only one is passed in explicitly. The value that is assigned to the variable `self` is passed in implicitly, so you do not need to do it yourself. However, even though the process is done implicitly, you always need to include the `self` variable in the constructor's parameters.

In addition, if you do not write a constructor of your own, the interpreter will create a default constructor to create an instance of the class.

*Variables*

The next part to look at is variables of the class. In the previous example, there were three, which were `brand`, `vel`, and `color`. In every class in Python, there can be two types of variables: class and instance variables. Class variables are associated with the class itself whereas instance variables are associated with each instance of the object.

Class variables are attributes that must be common to _all_ the instances of a class. Therefore, in this example, all `Car` objects that we are creating represent cars that are manufactured by BMW. On the other hand, instance variables are attributes that are unique to each instance of a class. For example, even though we are working with cars manufactured by BMW, each car will have unique attributes, including colors, speed, tire types, and seat color.

In the previous example, the `brand` variable is a class variable, and `vel` and `color` are instance variables. Class variables are defined in the class while instance variables are defined in the constructor.

[source,python]
----
 1    class Car:
 2
 3        brand = 'BMW'  # --> Class variable
 4
 5        def __init__(self, color):
 6            self.vel = 0        # --> Instance variable
 7            self.color = color  # --> Instance variable
----

You can access a class variable in the following manner:

[source,python]
ClassName.variable_name

You can access an instance variable in the following manner:

[source,python]
instance_name.variable_name

For example,

[source,python]
----
car1, car2 = Car('red'), Car('blue')
print(car1.color, car2.color)
print(Car.brand)

# Change class variable
Car.brand = 'Mercedes'
print(car1.info(), car2.info(), sep='\n')

# Create new instance variables
car1.wheels = 4
car2.wheels = 2
print(car1.wheels, car2.wheels)
----

.*Output*
----
red blue
BMW
Brand: Mercedes, Color: red, Speed: 0
Brand: Mercedes, Color: blue, Speed: 0
4 2
----

It is also possible to access the `brand` variable by writing `car1.brand` or `car2.brand`, but that will defeat the purpose of using a class variable. If you make a change to a class variable, it will be reflected across all instances of that class. However, if you write `car1.brand = 'Mercedes'` in an attempt to change the class variable, the interpreter will create a new instance variable `brand` for `car1` and update that value only. Hence, this shows that if a class and instance variables share the same name, the instance variable takes priority.

[source,python]
----
car1, car2, car3 = Car('red'), Car('blue'), Car('green')
car1.brand = 'Mercedes'
print(car1.brand, car2.brand, car3.brand)
print(Car.brand)

Inside the constructor (lines 6-7), the `self` variable was used to access the instance variables because `self` represents the current instance of the class. Instance variable assignment inside constructors generally follow this format:

[source,python]
self.variable_name = value

Therefore, in line 7, `self.color` refers to the instance variable `color`, while `color` on the right hand side refers to the value passed in as the parameter. This way, the instance variables and parameters may share the same name without confusing the interpreter.

*Methods*

The last component is methods. Methods are basically functions that are associated with an object, as covered before. If you recall, some methods associated with lists, strings, and other data structures were introduced in previous chapters. In the example `Car` class, shown earlier, the following are its methods:

[source,python]
----
...
 9        def accelerate(self, vel):
10            self.vel += vel
11
12        def brake(self, vel):
13            self.vel -= vel
14
15        def info(self):
16            return 'Brand: {}, Color: {}, Speed: {}'.format(Car.brand, self.color, self.vel)
...
----

We can see that the `Car` class contains three methods: `accelerate()`, `brake()`, and `info()`. A common point shared by all three methods is that they all take `self` as a parameter, which means that they take the instance of the class as parameter. Similar to constructors, the passing of `self` parameter is done implicitly, but you must directly specify the variable when writing the methods.

You can access methods in the following manner:

[source,python]
instance_name.method(params*)

The asterisk after `params` indicate that it should be provided when necessary. Here is an example of the methods in use:

.*Example Snippet of Game Source Code*
[source,python]
----
1    player = Car('blue')
2    while game_is_not_finished:
3        if accel_button_press:
4            player.accelerate(10)  # accerelate method
5        if brake_button_press:
6            player.brake(10)  # brake method
...
----

The above snippet allows the in-game car to accelerate if the user presses the accelerate button and decelerate if the user presses the brake button. We can see that when we wish to use class methods, we need to use a specific instance - `player` in the above example. We do not write `Car.brake()`, but rather, `player.brake()`. It is the same as when you use methods for lists or strings.

However, there are situations when you may use the class name when accessing a method. Just like variables, methods can also be separated into class and instance methods (and static methods). These will not be covered in this chapter. You can research more into this personally if you are interested.

==== Class Naming Convention

Just like how variables had naming conventions, classes also have specific guidelines on how to name them. Remember that, in Python, variable names had separate words connected with underscores. This is referred to as _snake_case_. Unlike variables, however, classes, in Python, are in _PascalCase_. As the word itself shows, PascalCase is when each separate word are joined together with no spaces and with first letter of each word capitalized. `Car`, `GameBoard`, and `PlayerManager` are all examples of PascalCase.

====
Another commonly used case in other languages, such as Java and C/C++, is _camelCase_. It is identical to PascalCase, except that the first letter of the first word is lower-cased. `car`, `gameBoard`, and `playerManager` are examples of camelCase.

=== Inheritance

Inheritance is a very important concept in OOP, which outlines the hierarchical relationship between different objects. We can find object hierarchies in the real world as well. Let's look at the figure below.

image::ch7_inheritance1.jpg[width=60%,align="center"]

In the real world, there are many "subcategories" of animals. A `Cat`, `Dog`, and a `Bird` are all ``Animal``s. In OOP, this relationship is called *_is-a_* relationship. A `Cat` _is-a_(n) `Animal`, and a `Dog` _is-a_(n) `Animal`. However, the converse may not always be true. For example, an `Animal` may not necessarily be a `Cat` (but rather, say, a `Bird`). This relationship can be extended for multiple levels of inheritance.

<<<

Take a look at the following figure:

image::ch7_inheritance2.jpg[width=60%,align="center"]

A `Poodle` is-a `Dog`, _and_ a `Poodle` is-a(n) `Animal` (because a `Dog` is-a(n) `Animal`). However, a `Dog` may not always be a `Poodle`, and likewise, an `Animal` may not always be a `Poodle`.

Another thing to note is that the objects at a lower level can do _all_ the things the objects at a higher level can do. For example, all animals can move and make sounds, which means cats, dogs, and birds can also move and make sounds. Also, all animals have limbs (let's suppose this is true for the sake of simplicity), which means cats, dogs, and birds also have limbs.

Furthermore, objects at a lower level can do _more specific_ things and/or have _more specific_ attributes than the objects at a higher level. For example, cats and dogs can run and walk, while (most) birds can fly. Cats purr, dogs bark, and birds chirp; cats and dogs have four legs, whereas birds have two.

[NOTE]
====
[small]#Objects at lower and higher level refer to objects that are directly (or transitively) "connected" by the green arrow.#
====

The following chart may be easier to understand:

image::ch7_inheritance3.jpg[width="90%",align="center"]

In programming terms, objects at a higher level are called superclasses or parent classes, while objects at a lower level are called subclasses or child classes.

You can create superclasses as you would a regular class. Remember that attributes are simulated as variables and behaviors as methods. Let's create the `Animal` class discussed previously.

.*animal.py*
[source,python]
----
 1    class Animal:
 2
 3        def __init__(self, leg):
 4            self.leg = leg     # attribute 1
 5
 6        def move(self):        # behavior 1
 7            print('animal moved forward')
 8
 9        def make_sound(self):  # behavior 2
10            print('animal made a sound')
----

Now how should we create the subclasses? A subclass should be able to do all the things its superclass can do. This means that the subclass should at least have access to all the attributes and methods its superclass has. This is called inheriting. We say that the subclass _inherits_ attributes and methods from its superclass. Let's take a look at a simple example.

.*cat.py*
[source,python]
----
1    from animal import Animal
2
3    class Cat(Animal):
4        pass
----

First, ensure that you have `animal.py` and `cat.py` saved in the same directory. The first line basically means that from `animal.py`, import the `Animal` class into the current file. This step is necessary in order to be able to access the `Animal` class (variables and methods) inside the `cat.py` file. The `pass` keyword in line 4 is a dummy line that the interpreter will ignore.

The real important part is line 3. See that after the class name, `Cat`, there is the `Animal` class placed inside parentheses. This signifies that the `Cat` class is a subclass of the `Animal` class. Other than that, see that no variables or methods are declared for the class. Now let's see how inheritance works. Open Python shell in the same directory as your animal classes.

.*Inheritance Example (Python Shell)*
----
>>> from animal import Animal
>>> from cat import Cat
>>> animal, cat = Animal(4), Cat(4)
>>> animal.move()
animal moved forward
>>> cat.move()
animal moved forward
>>> animal.make_sound()
animal made a sound
>>> cat.make_sound()
animal made a sound
----

If we see the interaction, we can see that `cat` (an instance of `Cat`) has access to a constructor and the `move()` and `make_sound()` methods, even though nothing was explicitly written inside the `cat.py` file. This is because `Cat` was declared as a subclass of the `Animal` class. In doing so, the `Cat` class gained access to, or _inherited_, all the variables and methods of the `Animal` class.

Besides inheriting, it was said that subclasses can do or have more specific actions and attributes. This means two things:

. A subclass can declare new variables/methods
. A subclass can specify new values/behaviors to existing variables/methods

Let's see how to do both in the next example.

.*cat.py*
[source,python]
----
 1    from animal import Animal
 2
 3    class Cat(Animal):
 4
 5        def __init__(self, name):
 6            super().__init__(4)  # Inherit variable (leg)
 7            self.name = name     # Create new variable
 8
 9        def move(self):        # Override method 1
10            print(self.name, 'pounced')
11
12        def make_sound(self):  # Override method 2
13            print(self.name, 'purred')
14
15        def groom(self):       # Create new method
16            print(self.name, 'is grooming itself')
----

There are many things to digest so let's look at things one by one.

*New Constructor (Lines 5-7)*

The method at lines 5-7 is the constructor of the `Cat` class. We can see that it takes one (explicit) parameter, `name`. In line 6, there is a function that we have never seen before: the `super()` function. This function represents the superclass(es) of the current class, which, in this case, is the `Animal` class. So what line 6 is doing is that it is calling the constructor of its superclass (`Animal` class) and passing `4` as a parameter, which the `Animal` class stores inside the `leg` variable. Then, in line 7, it creates a new variable, `name`.

So, in summary, an instance of the `Animal` class will have *one* attribute, `leg`, whereas an instance of the `Cat` class will have *two*, `leg` (inherited) and `name` (new attribute).

[start=2]
*Overridden Methods (Lines 9-13)*

As the comments show, the `move()` and `make_sound()` are _overridden_ methods. In OOP, method overriding when a subclass implements new behaviors for an already existing method (in its superclass). This is to allow the subclasses to implement more specific and suitable behaviors to a rather general method of its superclass(es).

For example, in the case of `make_sound()` method, it was changed so that an instance of the `Cat` class can make the purring sound instead of just a general sound.

[start=3]
*New Methods (Lines 15-16)*

Other than overriding existing methods, subclasses can also create new methods to emulate more specific actions. In this example, because grooming is unique to cats, it was created as a new method in lines 15-16. This is a subclass-specific method that its superclass(es) cannot access.

Let's take a look at the interaction between the two classes once more. Open the Python shell in the same directory where the `animal.py` and `cat.py` files are located.

.*Example Interaction (Python Shell)*
----
>>> from animal import Animal
>>> from cat import Cat
>>> bird, cat = Animal(2), Cat('Leo')
>>> print(bird.leg, cat.leg)
2 4
>>> bird.name
...
AttributeError: 'Animal' object has no attribute 'name'
>>> cat.name
'Leo'
>>> bird.move()
animal moved forward
>>> cat.move()
Leo pounced
>>> bird.make_sound()
animal made a sound
>>> cat.make_sound()
Leo purred
>>> animal.groom()
...
AttributeError: 'Animal' object has no attribute 'groom'
>>> cat.groom()
Leo is grooming itself
----

You can try out more things to better understand the relationship between superclasses and subclasses. Try tweaking the methods a bit. For example, add the statement `super().move()` between lines 9 and 10 of `cat.py` and see what happens.

.#*Exercise 7.4: Create your own classes*#
----
Using cat.py as reference, create your own Dog and Bird classes inside dog.py and bird.py files. Make sure to put the two files in the same directory where cat.py and animal.py are located.

Create new variables and methods, override constructors and other methods, and try to become more familiar with classes in general. Make use of the super() function to familiarize yourself with that concept as well.

==== _is-a_ Relationship

The is-a relationship was one shared between superclasses and their subclasses. Taking `Animal` and `Cat` as examples,

. `Cat` is-a(n) `Animal`

. `Animal` is not a `Cat`

In programming terms, we can also say the following:

. A `Cat` object is also of type `Animal`

. An `Animal` object is not of type `Cat`

We can check this relationship inside Python as well through the built-in `isinstance(object, type)` function. Open the Python shell in the same directory where the `animal.py` and `cat.py` files are located.

.*_is-a_ Relationship inside Python (Python Shell)*
----
>>> from animal import Animal
>>> from cat import Cat
>>> animal, cat = Animal(4), Cat('Leo')

>>> isinstance(animal, Cat)  # Statement 2
False
>>> isinstance(cat, Cat)

Create a Circle class with the following attributes and methods:

*Attributes*

    center: Point object representing the center point of circle
    r     : radius of circle (int)

*Methods*

    contains(point): Return True if given point lies inside or on this Circle
                            False otherwise

Create a Test class with a default constructor. Create two methods called rand_point() and test().

The rand_point() will look like this:

        from random import random  # Place at top of file

        def rand_point(self):
                return Point(random(), random())

    which returns a random Point where 0.0 <= x, y < 1.0

Inside this method, you should do the following:

    1. Create a Circle object with center (0, 0) and radius 1
    2. Create a for loop that iterates n (= 1,000) times. In each iteration, create a random Point using rand_point(). Check if the Point is contained inside the Circle created in step 1. Count the total number of Points that are in the Circle and store it in the variable p_in.
    3. Return 4 * p_in / n
    4. Try increasing n declared in step 2 (10_000, 1_000_000, 5_000_000), and see how the return value changes.
